Dec 30, 2015 (UN News Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- It began when the United Nations was not even three years old, in the fog of the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948, the Organization's first peacekeeping mission - 120 unarmed men in motley uniforms, not a gun between them, fanning out across scrubby hilltops and desert cliffs to monitor a shaky truce.
Now, as the UN celebrates its 70th birthday, this brittle seed has grown into 71 well-armed forces over the intervening years, comprising hundreds of thousands of troops and police from scores of donating Member States, equipped with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for reconnaissance and muscular mandates to take the initiative in using force to protect civilians.
Maintaining international peace and security is one of the three principal pillars of the UN edifice, together with promoting development and ensuring the observance of human rights, and the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), no geographical marker in its name, was the world body's very first peacekeeping effort.
Now, the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) has nearly 125,000 personnel, over 106,000 of them uniformed, from 122 countries, deployed in 16 current operations worldwide, including that very first pioneer set up on 29 May, 1948, and renewed every year since, a sad and ironic commentary on the difficulty of achieving lasting peace.
The past 14 months have been ""a pivotal time"" for UN peacekeeping, in the words of Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Herve Ladsous, citing a summit this past September that pledged 40,000 uniformed personnel, and a global chiefs of defence meeting in March that sought to improve operational efficiency.
""We had a world-first this March this year by convening 110 chiefs of staff of armies from around the world,"" he told the UN News Centre in an interview. ""That had never happened before.
Another first was the peacekeeping summit convened at UN Headquarters in September during the annual high-level segment of the General Assembly.
""The peacekeeping summit gave an opportunity to 54 countries - mostly at heads of State or government level - to pledge a number of things that we badly need, more people to the tune of potentially 40,000 military, police and so on, but also a number of enabling units, equipment that we need, including helicopters, engineering capacities, airlift.""
In the spring Mr. Ladsous created ""a strategic force generation unit"" to look ahead over the next three to five years at what requirements are going to be and how to adjust these with the offers.
In a glass-enclosed case just outside Mr. Ladsous's office on the 35th floor of the Secretariat building at UN Headquarters in New York resides the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to UN Peacekeeping Forces in 1988 for making important contributions towards the realization of one of the UN's fundamental tenets.
""Thus, the world Organization has come to play a more central part in world affairs and has been invested with increasing trust,"" the citation said.
It is doubtful that anyone at Lake Success, the UN's temporary headquarters outside New York City on that distant spring day in 1948, could have foreseen what UNTSO would lead to, not even the then 11-member
 

Security Council which had just set it up to assist a UN monitor in supervising a ceasefire between newly founded Israel and Arab forces in Palestine.
Some 70 military observers, mainly from the United States and Belgium, accompanied by 50 equally unarmed UN guards from Lake Success, began arriving the following month, without the distinctive blue berets or helmets that now distinguish UN forces, giving them the 'blue helmets' moniker.
Thus was born the UN role in peacekeeping on the ground, followed in 1949 by the creation of the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to supervise a ceasefire between those two foes.
The official switch over from observing to peacekeeping did not occur until several years later, and the earliest armed peacekeeping operation, the First UN Emergency Force (UNEF I), was deployed in the Middle East in 1956 to tackle the Suez Crisis, by which time UN military fashion had introduced the blue headgear.
But these earliest pioneers in UN peacekeeping in 1948 faced the same dangers that have seen more than 3,400 peacekeepers from some 120 countries give their lives while serving under the UN flag, either to hostile action, disease or accidents.
Commandant Rene de Labarriere of France became the first UN peacekeeper to die in the line of duty when his jeep hit a mine on 6 July, 1948. Little over two months later, on 17 September, the mediator himself, Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden, and an aide were assassinated by Israeli extremists.
DPKO itself did not come into existence until 1992 when the number and complexity of peacekeeping missions required a fully dedicated administration. Before that, the missions were operated through the UN Office of Special Political Affairs.
The UN Operation in the Congo (ONUC), launched in 1960, was the first large-scale 'blue helmet' mission, with nearly 20,000 military personnel seeking to hold back the tide of war when the vast country exploded into violence just after gaining independence.
The mission highlighted the risks in trying to bring stability to war-torn regions - a death toll of 250 UN personnel, including then Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold, killed in an air crash.
By now the UN had expanded its field operations from military personnel observing ceasefires to complex multidimensional enterprises designed to ensure implementation of comprehensive peace agreements and lay the foundations for sustainable peace, increasingly in cases of civil wars, by helping to build institutions, monitor human rights, reform the security sector, and disarm and reintegrate former combatants.
Although the military remains the backbone of most missions, these enlarged peacekeeping functions also require administrators, economists, police officers, legal experts, de-miners, electoral observers, human rights monitors, civil affairs and governance specialists, humanitarian workers, and communications and public information experts.
Just between 1989 and 1994, the Security Council authorized 20 new missions, raising the number of peacekeepers from 11,000 to 75,000, to enforce ceasefires that had already been agreed and lay the foundations for stability.
By the mid-1990s the Security Council was increasingly mandating under-manned operations to crisis points where the guns were still spitting out death, and there was no peace in fact to keep.
In Rwanda the few hundred troops of the UN Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) were too few to prevent the genocide of up to 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu extremists in 1994.
In the former Yugoslavia the few hundred soldiers of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Srebrenica were too few to prevent the massacre of up to 8,000 Muslim men and boys by Bosnian Serbs in 1995.
As for Somalia, the country was so riven by warring factions that there was no way the UN Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) in 1993 could fulfil its mandate ""to take appropriate action, including enforcement measures, to establish throughout Somalia a secure environment for humanitarian assistance,"" completing through disarmament and reconciliation the task begun by an earlier mission. It was withdrawn two years later.
It was time for the Security Council and DPKO to learn from these lessons, with investigations held into all three, culminating in 2000 in the so-called Brahimi Report, named after veteran diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi, Chair of the Panel that produced it.
It called for renewed political commitment on the part of Member States, significant institutional change and increased financial support to ensure that 'blue helmets' were never again put into such untenable situations.
 

Since then UN peacekeeping missions have achieved some notable successes, sometimes alone, sometimes with Member States as partners, as they confront an increasingly varied number of calls for help, from Kosovo to South Sudan and from Haiti to Timor-Leste.
They have brought relative stability to seemingly intractable issues, often with proactive mandates strengthened for a wider use of force if necessary, especially in the protection of civilians.
In Liberia they pacified a seemingly interminable and brutal civil war, ensuring the demobilization and reintegration of former foes and presiding over a series of democratic elections. In Timor-Leste they shepherded a new nation to independence from Indonesia.
In Cote d'Ivoire, together with French forces, they ended an increasingly bloody outbreak of violence when the incumbent president ignored his electoral loss.
In the current conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR), they are increasingly performing police functions, with the power to arrest in Bangui, the capital, where order has broken down.
Nor are they slouches in the technology field, increasingly using UAVs for surveillance, intelligence and the protection of civilians, though for November's visit by Pope Francis to Bangui, where they ensured security, UN personnel resorted to less high-tech equipment, using tethered balloons with an array of cameras and sensors.
""[This] enabled us to have a real-time view of the whole capital, see demonstrations as they are taking shape and therefore being able to act without delay,"" said Mr. Ladsous, who stressed the changing aspects of the missions.
""One of the greatest challenges has to do with the protection of civilians,"" he stressed. ""This is the heart of most of the missions of the last 10 or 12 years - a pro-active, dynamic, robust posture, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), to neutralize armed groups.""
In the DRC, where the UN has been present under different names since the ONUC mission over 50 years ago, the current UN Organization Stabilization Mission (MONUSCO), with nearly 20,000 uniformed personnel, has a particularly proactive mandate.
It is endowed with a specialized ""intervention brigade"" of three infantry battalions, one artillery and one special force and reconnaissance company mandated to neutralize armed groups to re-establish state authority and protect civilians in the apparently endless conflicts shaking the eastern part of the vast country.
Though the UN has no army of its own, with both commanders and troops coming from contributing countries, it has to foot the bill, again by seeking Member State contributions, at no small cost: the budget for the year beginning 1 July, 2015 is $8.27 billion.
Mr. Ladsous also stresses the changing nature of conflicts where non-State actors are rising to the fore. ""We're not dealing with governments, but mostly with non-State actors including terrorist and jihadist groups and transnational criminals. So it requires a major change in the way we operate,"" he said.
He highlighted the need to invest in technology, intelligence and information gathering ""because if you want to survive a terrorist environment like Mali you need that information.
""We are not a tool against terrorists... but we are targets and we have to put a lot of effort in being able to face that. We are not an anti-terrorist tool; in the north of Mali that task has been entrusted by the Council to the French, but we have to be able to do the job in that ambience.""
As for that very first operation set up 67 years ago, its functions have changed from time to time in light of changing circumstances, as after the 1956, 1967 and 1973 wars, with its observers acting as go-betweens for the hostile parties and as a means to contain isolated incidents from escalating into major conflicts.
Today groups of UNTSO observers are attached to peacekeeping forces in the area: the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan and the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), while a group of observers remain in Sinai to maintain a UN presence there.
As of 30 June it had grown to 142 military observers, 89 international civilian personnel and 146 local civilian staff. Its death toll has grown over the years, too, to 50 - 18 troops, 18 military observers, eight international civilians and six local civilians.
UNTSO observers are still patrolling some of those very same hills their predecessors did in 1948 along the lines between Israel and Lebanon - but this time with blue headgear.
 

Major-General Arthur David Gawn of New Zealand, a veteran of UN operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Timor-Leste, now presides over the force at its headquarters in Jerusalem atop the Hill of Evil Counsel thus named since Byzantine tradition identifies it as the place where High Priest Caiphas and his colleagues decided to arrest Jesus. As for heading the UN's very first peacekeeping operation, he notes that his connections with the area go way back before 29 May, 1948. ""Beer Sheba (Israel), the whole of the Palestine area, even Egypt, that's where my grandfather fought, a long time ago, in the camel corps (in the First World War),"" he told the UN News Centre.",From a First Mission of 120 Unarmed Men - UN Peacekeeping Across the Decades,All Africa AFNWS English

New Delhi, 28 Dec: India has committed to deploy a fresh contingent of over 100 paramilitary troops for rendering special police combat and security duties under the United Nations (UN) flag in the African nation of Liberia.
The all-male personnel unit has been carved out from paramilitary Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and this will be the first squad of the border guarding force to be sent for UN duties in the 52 years of its existence.
Officials said the decision was recently notified by the Union Home Ministry after SSB Director General B D Sharma prepared and submitted a proposal in this regard sometime back.
Officials said the contingent - called the Formed Police Unit (FPU) - is expected to take position in Liberia by late next year.
""The team could be about 140 personnel strong,"" they said.
The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), since 2007, is the only Indian force which is deployed in this west African country under the UN umbrella to bring peace and stability in the region and provide security to the locals.
The CRPF has an all-women unit deployed there in addition to a male FPU and they not only provide security cover to the Prime Minister of Liberia but also train the local police in tackling the security challenges and civil war instances in the country under the banner of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).
The UNMIL was set up in September 2003 to ""support the implementation of the ceasefire agreement and the peace process, protect United Nations staff, facilities and civilians, support humanitarian and human rights activities as well as assist in national security reform including national police training and formation of a new, restructured military.""
The mission is headquartered in the capital city of Monrovia and has close to 6,000 uniformed personnel, drawn from various countries.
Officials said the new SSB squad will soon be handpicked from amongst the about 80,000 personnel strong force and will subsequently be sent for a special UN Civilian Police (CIVPOL) training in the national capital.
The men will be trained in commando tactics, special driving skills and other subjects of international policing, they said.
The squad will be deployed in Liberia for a year after which it will be replaced by another team from SSB as per government directives, they said.
SSB is mandated to guard the open Indian frontiers with Nepal and Bhutan along with rendering multiple tasks in the law and order and anti-Naxal operations domain.

John Kirby Spokesperson Daily Press Briefing Washington, DC December 17, 2015 [http://video.state.gov/en/video/4666108450001] Index for Today's Briefing *WTO/LIBERIA/AFGHANISTAN *LIBYA *SYRIA *SYRIA/ISIL *JAPAN/SOUTH KOREA *MIDDLE EAST PEACE *DEPARTMENT *IRAQ/RUSSIA *CUBA *IRAQ/TURKEY TRANSCRIPT: ________________________________ 1:30 p.m. EST MR KIRBY: Hello, everybody. Afternoon. What a lively bunch. Just to -QUESTION: It's the rain. MR KIRBY: What's that? QUESTION: It's the rain. MR KIRBY: It's the rain. Sorry about that. QUESTION: Yeah, it's all your fault. MR KIRBY: I wish -- yeah, I wish I could do something about that. Just a short note on WTO membership. We welcome the finalization of Liberia and Afghanistan's terms of accession to the World Trade Organization on the 16th and 17th, in Nairobi. For Afghanistan, accession to the WTO is a major step forward for the Afghan Government's efforts to unlock the potential of the Afghan economy. Today's announcement is the result of years of work, which has accelerated over the last year, under the leadership of the national unity government. WTO accession is a  

process, and the Afghan Government needs to work with parliament and other stakeholders to take steps needed to receive the full benefits of membership.
Liberia's accession to WTO is the result of the resilient leadership of President Johnson Sirleaf and the minister of trade and industry, Axel Addy. We applaud Liberia for completing an ambitious, high-quality accession package as a least-developed country, and we look forward to working with Liberia in the future as a member.
With that, Matt.
QUESTION: I just want to start really briefly with that. Do you have -- you don't have anything to say about the Libya agreement being signed?
MR KIRBY: Yeah, I can speak to that. The United States welcomes the signing of the political agreement in -I'm sorry, in Morocco, by Libyans, prepared based on a year of UN-facilitated political dialogue. The agreement provides the framework for establishing a unified Libyan Government of National Accord, and we applaud the efforts of those courageous Libyan leaders to rebuild a united Libya. I would also add that a Government of National Accord is needed to address the country's critical humanitarian, economic, and security challenges, and as the December 13th conference in Rome, co-chaired by Secretary Kerry and the Italian foreign minister, Gentiloni -- at that conference the United States and the international community made clear that we stand ready to support the implementation of the political agreement and are committed to providing the unified government full political backing and technical, economic, security, and counterterrorism assistance.
And we would also like to express our gratitude to the Kingdom of Morocco for its efforts to advance the UN talks and our full support to all of those Libyans participating in the process. The U.S. will stand with you as you take the next steps necessary to build Libyan peace and security.
QUESTION: Okay. If -- as long as nobody has anything else about that -- you do?
QUESTION: Libya. The reports in the British press right now that Downing Street would consider sending British troops to Libya if this new administration asked for it -- peacekeeping forces. Do you have a position on that? And if a similar request was made to Washington, what kind of a response would there be?
MR KIRBY: Well, I won't speak to the -- whatever decisions the United Kingdom might make. Those are sovereign decisions that governments make for themselves. I know of no such decision pending here in the United States, and that would be really more of a matter for the Defense Department to speak to.
QUESTION: So what I wanted to do is look ahead a little bit to tomorrow's meetings in New York.
MR KIRBY: Sure, sure.
QUESTION: Do you expect that either the meeting in the morning of the support group or the Security Council meeting in the afternoon -- what do you expect them to produce?
MR KIRBY: The --
QUESTION: I know the Security Council, you expect a resolution, but what do you expect to be in it? And do you expect them to put anything out after the morning meeting?
MR KIRBY: So -- all right, well, let's go to the resolution first since that -- we do hope that that is the result, the tangible resolution that would affirm the process established by the ISSG and chart the next steps to begin negotiations. And as the Secretary has said, we are also laying the groundwork to implement a nationwide ceasefire, and so there could be components of that that address sort of a framework of what a ceasefire might look like.
So the big result for the afternoon session is obviously this resolution, and the Secretary remains confident that we can get there. In the morning, this is -- this meeting in the morning is sort of -- is the next iteration of the ISSG process, the Vienna process as it is also known. And I think what the participants are going to try to do in the morning session is provide -- get to more detail about the political transition itself and the process, the framework going forward, get to some more fidelity. I think they're going to be interested in getting a readout from Saudi leaders about the Riyadh conference, a little bit more detail about how that went and where things stand with the high negotiating committee of the opposition groups because their next task is to get together and establish a negotiating team. So I think there's going to be an expectation that Saudi leadership will be able to kind of read that out some more. I fully expect that they will be interested in talking to the Jordanian delegation about their efforts in terms of the identification of groups that can move forward in the political process.
 

And then I think -- pursuant to the ceasefire issue, I think you will see them spend a bit of time tomorrow morning on that. You know the Secretary has talked about the importance of getting a ceasefire in place for quite some time and he believes it's time to start laying out more detail about what that could look like, how that would be monitored, when it could be implemented, that kind of thing.
So I think there's a full agenda, obviously, of things to talk about. But in the aggregate what I would tell you is two things: this is an iterative process, so this is the next step in the Vienna process, another meeting; and that as the last two have borne out, what would like after this one would be, again, more detail, more process that can be agreed upon going forward.
QUESTION: Right. But do you expect them to produce some kind of a document or a communique that would lay out what they've heard or what they've agreed on in terms of --
MR KIRBY: I can't rule out a communique at the end of the morning session, Matt. I don't know that they've come to --
QUESTION: All right.
MR KIRBY: I don't know that we're -- I can't say that it will or won't be -- there won't be a communique. The big product for the day, quite frankly, would be the resolution at the end of it.
QUESTION: Would be the resolution. Okay. So where -- if there is a communique and then in the resolution that you've -- that the Secretary is confident will be passed by the Security Council, where in it will it spell out the timeline for Assad's departure?
MR KIRBY: I don't know that it will. I mean, I can't speak to a resolution that hasn't been solidified yet. So I don't know that that is intended to be part of the resolution itself. The resolution is going to be designed to put under UN auspices and the UN umbrella -- codifying under UN auspices the Vienna process and the culmination of the basic principles in the two communiques coming out of Vienna. So it's really designed to put under UN auspices what the ISSG has already worked out in terms of the core principles. And as you know, nowhere in those communiques has it been stated explicitly when Assad needs to go, when he needs to step down.
QUESTION: Right. So why is it that, exactly?
MR KIRBY: Well, I think it's --
QUESTION: This is your goal, your -- what you say is your goal and it is what the opposition says is its goal, correct? But it's not a guarantee, is it?
MR KIRBY: Our goal, just to be fair -- I mean, I --
QUESTION: Can you guarantee that this process will lead to Assad's departure?
MR KIRBY: Let me back up here, because there's a lot you just --
QUESTION: No, it's pretty straightforward.
MR KIRBY: No, I --
QUESTION: Can you or can you not?
MR KIRBY: Let me get there, Matt.
QUESTION: Okay.
MR KIRBY: The goal is a whole, unified, pluralistic, nonsectarian Syria. That's the goal. And everybody -everybody, I say everybody and Arshad gets on me -- the members of the ISSG, if you look at the communiques, have agreed to that as the end state. And the ISSG has also agreed that it is far preferable to get to that goal through a political process instead of a military one and that the Syrian voices need to be heard in that process and that this has to lead us to a government inclusive and representative of the Syrian people, which cannot be Assad.
QUESTION: Yeah, where is that, though, in the --
MR KIRBY: I'm getting there.
QUESTION: Okay.
 

MR KIRBY: So you asked me -- the first question you asked me is why isn't it in there. And the answer is because not everybody agrees.
QUESTION: Exactly. Well, I knew the answer to the question. But I wanted --
MR KIRBY: But then why did you ask me?
QUESTION: Well, because I'm -- because I want to go back to the little -- the discussion that was being had yesterday. You guys are signing off on an agreement that does not guarantee or even mention what one of your main policy -- what you claim is your main policy goal, right?
MR KIRBY: Well, in the work of bringing 20 participants together -- you know this better than me; I know you know this better than me -- when you're trying to drive to a conclusion --
QUESTION: Yeah.
MR KIRBY: -- a very specific one, you've got to start broad.
QUESTION: Right.
MR KIRBY: And so in Geneva, way back in 2012, and then of course we move forward to Vienna -- if you look at the first communique, very, very broad, not as many participants; the second Vienna communique -more specific, more participants. And now, here at the third gathering of the ISSG, if all goes well tomorrow, we'll end up with a UN Security Council resolution with more solidification.
QUESTION: Right.
MR KIRBY: So not everybody is unified about the future of Assad inside the ISSG. That comes as no surprise, I'm sure. And we understand that. What's important for the United States at this point in the process is that we keep driving towards the ultimate objective, which is a Syrian government away from Assad, toward inclusiveness and representative of the Syrian people. And we understand that there's an awful lot of work that still has to go to get to that goal. And one of the key issues still outstanding is the future of Assad and not only how long does he stay, but in what capacity does he stay. All that work still needs to be done.
QUESTION: Right.
MR KIRBY: And it is still -- but it is -- but don't mistake U.S. policy and U.S. objectives with the objectives being sought more broadly by 19 other participants. You can expect that not everything we may want to see and every way we want to see it is going to be reflected in the broader context.
QUESTION: I get it. But what you've just said is what you won't get agreement on is how long he stays and what position he'll be in as he stays, correct?
MR KIRBY: I didn't say we --
QUESTION: The key word is ""stay.""
MR KIRBY: I did not --
QUESTION: And --
MR KIRBY: Hang on --
QUESTION: -- what I'm -- my point is, is it not -- is it really your view, belief that Assad has to go? Is that not more of an aspirational thing than it is a policy thing that you can actually bring about?
MR KIRBY: Well, I think it can be both. Something can be aspirational and still be your policy. Our policy hasn't changed.
QUESTION: Yeah, but you -- then you would have to conduct yourself in a way that led to your aspiration going high. You're helping rebels who are not fighting Assad. You're -- and you're agreeing --
MR KIRBY: But are fighting ISIL.
QUESTION: Right, but you -- but your goal here is to get rid of Assad, you say.
MR KIRBY: I mean, there's two issues inside Syria, not --
QUESTION: Yeah. But you're -- but one of them is to get -- so your military assistance, what -- such as it is, it is not going to further your policy of getting rid of Assad.  

MR KIRBY: Because our policy is there has to be a political solution, not a military one.
QUESTION: No, no, because when the Secretary came into office, his entire point on Syria was that you had to change the calculation for Assad on the battlefield, change the -- to do things that change his calculation. That has not worked. He has -- he's still there. His calculation hasn't changed. You're signing on to a Russian plan -- am I right? -- that says nothing about Assad, correct?
MR KIRBY: I actually -- I think I'd take issue with some of what you just said, but there's so much in there. So look, our --
QUESTION: All right.
QUESTION: How about the part where --
MR KIRBY: Hang on a second.
QUESTION: -- it doesn't mention Assad? I like that last question. (Laughter.) Does it mention Assad --
QUESTION: And I will stop after this.
QUESTION: -- in the resolution that you plan on signing tomorrow?
MR KIRBY: I'm not going to get ahead of a resolution that hasn't been solidified yet, Justin. I just won't do it.
So look, a couple of big points here that I'd like to make. Our view about Assad and his future has not changed. We still believe that he cannot be a part of the future of Syria.
QUESTION: Right.
MR KIRBY: No, let me -- please let me finish.
QUESTION: But John, just -- you're -- it's our view, it's our belief.
MR KIRBY: It is. That is our policy. It has not changed. But the Secretary has also said, and you've heard him yourself over --
QUESTION: Yeah, but you -- at the same time as you say that, though, you talk about how long he stays and in what position he stays --
MR KIRBY: In what capacity.
QUESTION: In what capacity he stays is --
MR KIRBY: If you want to --
QUESTION: -- has not yet been decided. And what I'm trying to say is that the key word in those phrases is ""stays,"" not "" goes,"" no?
MR KIRBY: He -- yeah, right. But --
QUESTION: Okay. All right. I'm done.
MR KIRBY: Like, look, if you come to -- look, Matt, if you come to stay at my house, my expectation is eventually you're going to go. (Laughter.)
QUESTION: Well, you know what they say about --
MR KIRBY: Especially you, all right? So --
QUESTION: You know what they say about fish and guests, right?
MR KIRBY: Yeah, exactly, right? Okay. So we understand that during at least part of this political transition process -- I've said this before -- we -- there hasn't been decisions made about whether he leaves on day one, week one, month one. The Secretary said that himself. But that he has to go, that he has to give up power, that he cannot be the leader of Syria going forward --
QUESTION: Okay.
MR KIRBY: -- is not in dispute in terms of American policy. Not --
 

QUESTION: But I don't see anything in what you're doing -- what's going to happen tomorrow or what has happened to this point -- that says that. That's my only point, and I'll stop.
MR KIRBY: Okay. Long process. This is just -- this is the third gathering of the ISSG. I fully expect there will be more. I can't sit here and tell you straight up that tomorrow is going to solve all of the Assad issues. There is still disparity inside the ISSG about Assad and his future -- no question about that; nobody's arguing about that. That is why this process is so important. You keep -- and it's fair for you to say, well, there's nothing in the process; I don't see it -- fair. But the process is still fairly nascent in development.
QUESTION: The process has been -- no it's not. It's three years old. It's based on the Geneva --
MR KIRBY: This particular format is.
QUESTION: I know. I understand that, but there has been zero movement on Assad for three years. And so --
MR KIRBY: And it's not like we're being complacent about it or we're happy about it.
QUESTION: John, just to follow up on this point. Wouldn't you say that priorities have shifted or have changed since you guys took the position back in 2011? Secretary Clinton said that he has to go and his days are numbered and so on. With the rise of ISIS, the priorities have actually changed, where Assad might have --
MR KIRBY: No, I -- no, I disagree.
QUESTION: -- a role to play.
MR KIRBY: I disagree.
QUESTION: I mean, considering that there are minorities and people and populations and communities that look to him as their representative.
MR KIRBY: We talked about this yesterday, and I disagree. I mean, look, nothing's changed about our view that he can't be part of the future of Syria, that he needs to go. Nothing's changed about that. But you can't legislate diplomacy. It doesn't work like that. You don't sit down at a table with 19 other participants and say, ""And here's the day he has to go."" That would throw sand in the gears of this process faster than anything, and it would stop. And the Secretary, quite the contrary, wants to keep the momentum going. And the way you do that is you bring everybody in, all of the stakeholders, and you start to discuss these issues of contention. That's what diplomacy's about. It's about dealing with the areas in which you disagree. And so there's still disagreements; we know that. And it's still -- the process continues.
QUESTION: So let me ask you this. Was it a mistake, basically, to state this as a goal? Did it hamstring you in any way; did it really hinder your process, sort of constrained your elbow room and negotiation and so on by saying Assad must stay -- must go, and stating this as a primary goal of the whole thing rather than ending the civil war?
MR KIRBY: I don't think --
QUESTION: Rather than bringing about some sort of a political transition?
MR KIRBY: I don't think the Secretary would say that it's hampered the discussion at all. I mean, every participant in the ISSG has a view on Assad. And not all of them are the same. Many other nations share our same policies and -- with respect to Assad and his role in the future of Syria. Others do not. But some of those others who do not have influence with the Assad regime and have interest in Syria, and so those views have to be countered in and factored into the discussions, and they are, and they will be. But I don't want to leave you with the expectation that, A, our position has changed on Assad, or B, that we're going to have this entirely wrapped up and sealed in a nice little Christmas gift tomorrow. It's just not going to work that way. There's still a lot more work that has to be done.
QUESTION: For tomorrow, when -- we're a bit confused. If you could clarify, when the Jordanians come in and say these are the -- this is the moderate opposition that are going to be part of the process -- is that when it's -- it's going to happen during the morning session? Or is it tomorrow, or is it thereafter?
MR KIRBY: Well, as I said yesterday, it's not like -- it's not like a homework assignment. It's not like we said, ""Go here and turn in the list,"" okay?
QUESTION: Right. I understand.
 

MR KIRBY: But as I said to Matt, I think you can expect that the ISSG will be interested in hearing about Jordan's progress and the work that they're doing. It is going to be iterative. I can't tell you sitting here today that all of that's going to be resolved tomorrow, but certainly it's going to be a topic of discussion.
QUESTION: John --
MR KIRBY: Yeah, Nick.
QUESTION: -- along the same lines, you may remember what the Secretary said in Greece a few weeks ago. He said basically that if we want to see the opposition and the regime starting cooperating and discussing, there should be a level of confidence that at the end of the day, Assad will go. So can we expect that -- as Matt said, can we expect that this notion that Assad has to go without any timeline would appear in the UN resolution or communique at the end of the meeting in New York?
MR KIRBY: Again, I'm not going to get ahead of a resolution that's not been solidified yet. That's a big function and task tomorrow to get at that, and I just won't get ahead of it. But the Secretary wasn't wrong when he said, look, if you want to have political negotiations that include the opposition, with -- sitting down with the regime, you're not going to be able to get them to that -- to want to do that if there's not an expectation in their minds that Assad has to go. And that's been communicated.
QUESTION: Is this --
MR KIRBY: And they gathered in Riyadh, they came up with their own negotiating principles, and that's, again, all part of the process.
QUESTION: But should it be stated on paper that at the end of the day, Assad has to go and that this is -that the U.S., as you said yesterday, nobody has given up the notion that President Assad has to go? Can it be reason of --
MR KIRBY: There are still differences of opinion about Assad and his specific future. I would point you back to the Vienna communique, the last one in November, though. It did talk about getting to a unified, pluralistic, nonsectarian, whole Syria, right. Yes, I recognize it didn't say in there the three words ""Assad must go."" But it did talk about the kind of future that we were going to seek, and the process through which we wanted to seek it -- political process, negotiation, inclusive of the Syrian voice. It's safe to say, I think factually, that you're not going to be able to achieve that goal as stated in the Vienna communique with Assad still retaining full power and being in -- being the leader of his country. But we're not ready yet, I don't think, to commit in writing the specific parameters.
That's why these meetings are so important. That's why it still has to be discussed. But nothing's changed about our goal. I can't speak for every nation at the table. I can certainly speak for the United States. Nothing's changed about what we want to see in Syria, in particular what we want to see from a responsive and representative government in Syria that Syrians can be proud of and that can help not only sustain their security and their safety, but their prosperity.
Yeah, Justin.
QUESTION: I want to change topics.
QUESTION: Wait, just on -- I got one more.
QUESTION: (Inaudible.)
MR KIRBY: You said you were done.
QUESTION: Well, yeah, but you just raised this ""unified, pluralistic, nonsectarian,"" and ""whole Syria."" Prior to 2011, which of those adjectives applied to Syria?
MR KIRBY: Prior to 2011?
QUESTION: Prior to the uprising against him. Would you say that Syria was unified then? Was it nonsectarian then?
MR KIRBY: I don't know. I'm not a historian, Matt.
QUESTION: Was it whole?
MR KIRBY: I'm not a historian. All I know is that prior to the demonstrations, he had a choice of how he handled them, and he handled it exactly the wrong way.
 

Go ahead, Justin.
QUESTION: Do you have one on Syria?
QUESTION: Yeah.
QUESTION: Go ahead.
QUESTION: One on the same topic. As you mentioned, one of the goals of the morning meeting is to look at the possible implementation of a ceasefire. How close is the connection between getting this ceasefire going and this list that's being drafted by Jordan on terrorists? In other words, if there is not a finalized list from Jordan, is the process in moving forward with a ceasefire going to be delayed until there is a list and agreement on that list of who's a terrorist?
MR KIRBY: It's certainly going to -- that work will help inform the work of getting to a ceasefire. And I think you can expect that some groups, whether they're on a list or not -- I mean, if you're not willing to observe a ceasefire, then you're outside the parameters of a ceasefire. So I think it'll help inform those efforts, Pam, but if you're asking is it going to -- does it have to be done prior to, I would say not necessarily because the work of establishing the parameters of a ceasefire has to continue. And as I said, I think you can expect them to try to work their way through that tomorrow in New York. So, I mean, they're tandem efforts, they're related, and the Secretary believes they both need to move forward that way.
Yeah, Laura.
QUESTION: Yeah. Mine is on ISIS, so switching gears but still on Syria. There are some reports today that the U.S. has sent another shipment of ammunition to the Syrian Arab rebels that are taking on ISIS. I was wondering -- this is a little bit of a broad question -- but if you can sort of give us an assessment of have these moderate rebels made any progress towards going after ISIS, and is that something that you can quantify for us? I know that's a broad question.
MR KIRBY: I would really have to refer you to the Defense Department. Yeah, I mean, I'm not privy to information about materiel assistance to groups. It's really more for DOD to speak to. And as for specific -- all I can say is, broadly speaking, there are many groups that -- in the counter-ISIL campaign that we have worked with and will continue to work with and support. Not all are Arab groups, obviously. Some are Kurdish groups and some -- there's some Turkmen groups. But DOD is really in a better position to speak to progress on the ground, and I really try to stay away from that. But there has been, broadly speaking, many groups that have received support from the United States -- and from the coalition -- have made progress against ISIL inside Syria.
QUESTION: In terms of land, in terms of (inaudible)?
MR KIRBY: Yeah, in terms of territory retaken or regained, in terms of progress towards going after their infrastructure, their sources of revenue, and of course their loss of leadership at various levels.
QUESTION: Just one on that, John. I know it's a DOD -- maybe it's a DOD question, but apart from the Kurdish forces, even though you are -- you keep saying that all the weapons go to the Arab forces. Who else has made any progress against ISIS, really?
MR KIRBY: Again, I think I'm not going to give you an operational battlefield readout here. There has been progress made by not -- I mean, the Kurdish forces fighting ISIL have been very effective. There's no doubt about that, no question. And they continue to get support in terms of air power from the coalition. The other groups have made some progress too. I just don't have a readout here for you of every place on the battlefield and how it's going. But it's -- they're -- the groups fighting ISIL are not just Kurds. There are Turkmen, there are Arab groups, and they are fighting bravely. And to the degree that the coalition can, the coalition will continue to support them.
Okay. Yeah.
QUESTION: (Inaudible.)
MR KIRBY: Well, why can't we go to Japan?
QUESTION: We can go to Japan.
MR KIRBY: Are you sure? (Laughter.) Okay, go ahead.
QUESTION: Do you have any response to or comment on the acquittal of Japanese journalist Tatsuya Kato in South Korea?
 

MR KIRBY: I think I do somewhere in here. We are aware of reports that the Seoul Central District Court found Sankei Shimbun journalist Tatsuya Kato -- is that right --
QUESTION: Yes.
MR KIRBY: -- not guilty of defamation. We refer you to the South Korean Government for details of this legal proceeding.
QUESTION: May I follow up --
QUESTION: Do you --
QUESTION: -- on this?
QUESTION: That was --
MR KIRBY: You can.
QUESTION: We're aware of it.
MR KIRBY: You can certainly -- you can certainly give it a shot. Go ahead.
QUESTION: State Department in its annual Human Rights Report of the South Korea raised the concerns about the South Korea legal system related to defamation. Following this judgment, what do you expect Korean Government to do to improve the -- its press freedom situation?
MR KIRBY: On this -- on this judgment, again, I'm going to refer you to the South Korean Government. I think -- I'm not going to get into details on human rights issues in any one country. You can go to our website, look at our Human Rights Report. It's all there -- virtually every country in the world and it's publicly available -where we express our views and our concerns, and we're not bashful about doing that. But in terms of this specific case, I'd refer you to the South Korean Government.
QUESTION: But this specific case was mentioned in the Human Rights Report.
MR KIRBY: I'm -- I've said all I'm going to say on this.
Yeah, Said.
QUESTION: Can we change topics?
MR KIRBY: Yeah.
QUESTION: All right. Could I go to the Palestinian-Israeli issue?
MR KIRBY: Yeah, sure.
QUESTION: Okay. I wanted to ask you -- there was a rather pernicious video that came out yesterday by an organization called the Im Tirtzu that equates human rights -- Israeli human rights activists with terrorists and others, and quite intimidating. It's against B'Tselem, against Breaking the Silence and so on. I wonder if you have any comment on that. And some say that it is actually financed and supported by the Israeli Government.
MR KIRBY: Well, certainly aware of the reports. I don't have a lot of information on it at this time. As I would say -- as we've said in the past, that we want every government to do what it can to protect free expression and peaceful dissent and to create an atmosphere where all voices are heard. I mean, if allegations like that are true, obviously, that would be deeply concerning. But like I say, we're aware of it and we're monitoring it.
QUESTION: And I just want to follow up with two more questions, just if I may. I hope you indulge me. One on the -- on December 3rd, the Israelis announced that they arrested some groups responsible for the terror attack in Duma that killed the Dawabsha family. But today the Israeli defense minister told the Israeli army radio that they don't have enough evidence. Although they know the group, they cannot bring evidence. Do you have confidence in the Israeli -- in this case -- in the Israeli justice system to bring those perpetrators to justice, as you have demanded?
MR KIRBY: As we understand it, the investigation is still underway --
QUESTION: Right.
MR KIRBY: -- and we're going to wait and see what happens there. As I've also said before -- you've heard me say it's critical that the perpetrators of the attack against this family are prosecuted and they're brought to  

justice. As you know, we've condemned this vicious terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms, and we, again, convey our deep condolences to the family. But for specific details about something that's under investigation, I'd refer you to Israel authorities.
QUESTION: All right. And I have just a couple more. On the interview with Secretary Kerry with The New Yorker, he warned that Israel -- there is no two-state solution. Israel is either headed towards not being Jewish or not being democratic, which many talk about. But are we likely to see any kind of movement towards reigniting the peace process, perhaps getting something going, although everybody sort of discards that possibility in the next 10 months or so?
MR KIRBY: Well, I mean, that's really up for the parties to determine. We would still like to see progress made towards getting to a two-state solution, but it's going to take concerted effort by the parties. And as long as there continues to be violence and no affirmative action or steps taken to try to lay out a process forward, that's going to be exceedingly difficult. And the Secretary was very honest about that, not just when he was in the region but at a speech at the Saban Forum. But we are still interested in trying to pursue that goal, but we can't do it alone.
QUESTION: And I'm sorry, this is my last one. The Palestinian Authority, their law enforcement is -- there are allegations of torture in Israeli-Palestinian -- I mean, I'm sorry, Palestinian Authority jails and so on, of those are arrested and trying them and so on. I mean, you support Palestinian security forces, but obviously they are conducting or there are allegations that they are conducting torture against civilians and so on. Do you have any information on that? And do you have -- if you do, are you doing anything about it?
MR KIRBY: I don't have any specific information on that. Obviously, if it's true, that also would be deeply concerning to us and an issue that we would obviously want authorities to look into and to stop. But I don't have any specifics on it.
QUESTION: Thank you.
QUESTION: While we're on this -- in this area, I'm just wondering -- and if you don't have anything, if maybe you could just check -- I'm just wondering if there's an update on -- if you have an update on the confidence-building measures that were agreed to when the Secretary was in the region between the Israelis, the Jordanians, and to a certain extent the Palestinians -- in particular, the cameras.
MR KIRBY: I do not have an update on that.
QUESTION: Is that because there is no update?
MR KIRBY: I don't have an update on it. I'll take the question.
QUESTION: Okay. The -- it would be not just whether the cameras are -- but a month later -- it doesn't take a lot to string up some webcams or whatever. I'm just wondering, if there is a holdup, what it is. And then on the incitement part -- and you probably spoke about this while we were away with the Secretary, but if you haven't, could you do it now about President Abbas saying that the violence, the stabbing incidents, the car rammings, is justified?
MR KIRBY: No, we did address this.
QUESTION: You did? Okay.
MR KIRBY: We did address it, but I mean, I'm -- it's -- I'll say the same thing, which is that we're not going to react to each and every comment except to say that -- and we've said it before -- that we want to see affirmative action and steps taken by all sides here to include acts of rhetoric and other physical acts that do nothing but escalate the tensions.
QUESTION: Okay.
MR KIRBY: So I don't want to characterize each and every event. Let me take your question on the cameras --
QUESTION: On the cameras.
MR KIRBY: -- and the other measures.
QUESTION: But just on the kind of comments, though, do -- is that a -- do you regard a statement like that from the PA president as incitement, or --
MR KIRBY: As I said, I'm not going to characterize each and every comment. What we want to see more broadly is that each side take positive steps - 

QUESTION: Okay. Have you seen that?
MR KIRBY: -- to reduce the tension and the violence. Well, look, clearly there still are acts of violence. And as the Secretary said in a speech not long ago, just before the trip, there continues to be incitement to acts of violence, and we need to see that stop. But I'm not going to characterize each and every comment.
QUESTION: Well, right, I understand that. But if you can't characterize what is incitement and what is not, how can you call for an end to it?
MR KIRBY: Because it still happens, it's still going on, and --
QUESTION: Yeah. So --
MR KIRBY: -- but I'm not going to use the podium to react to each and every comment made and each and every statement. I think incitement is a fairly self-evident thing. We want it to stop. To the degree that it leads to additional violence, that's not good for anybody there or in the region.
QUESTION: Except that it's not self-evident to the people who are saying it. If they don't think they're inciting something, they're not going to stop doing it. If you think that it is incitement and others think that it is, then shouldn't it be called out as incitement?
MR KIRBY: And the Secretary has. He's spoken very baldly about --
QUESTION: But you just said you're not going to --
MR KIRBY: -- about acts of incitement and inflammatory rhetoric that we want to see stop. I know what you'd like me to do, which is to --
QUESTION: No, I just want --
MR KIRBY: -- characterize each statement, and I won't do that.
QUESTION: Well, I want you to call a spade a spade. If you think that something's incitement and you think that someone is not doing what you've asked them to do, I would expect that the Government of the United States would call them out on it and say, ""Look, you can't -- you shouldn't be saying things like this.""
MR KIRBY: We --
QUESTION: But if you don't want to characterize every statement, then why even bother calling for an end to incitement?
MR KIRBY: We have made that argument, that exact argument, very clear publicly, and we've made it privately with leaders on all sides.
Justin.
QUESTION: Thanks. I'd like to change the subject to the email controversy. You probably saw today that Ash Carter -- it was reported that he had been using his own private email account to conduct official business during the few first months of his tenure at the DOD, in violation of DOD rules. And this was after the Clinton scandal broke. And back in October, you acknowledged that Secretary Kerry uses his private email and that it's scrubbed occasionally by State Department employees to see if he's conducting any official business. So is there really a difference between what he's doing and what Carter is doing, and have you found that he's been using his private email for official business since this whole Clinton story broke?
MR KIRBY: Well, I'm -- I think the Pentagon has already spoken to Secretary Carter's email use, and I'm not going to characterize it. It wouldn't be appropriate. What I can say is what we've said before, that Secretary Kerry primarily uses a state.gov email account for his daily work, and he takes the steps necessary to ensure that his records are appropriately captured regardless of their origin. And his use of email is in line with Department policy. So to the degree that a private email is sent to him or used by him, it is appropriately preserved and captured and archived, as it should be. But he does his work primarily on his state.gov account.
QUESTION: Would you also say that he occasionally uses his private email for work business, whether inadvertent or not?
MR KIRBY: It is -- the short answer is of course. He can't prevent somebody from emailing him if they have his private email account. But when that happens, we have a process in place and a system -- and it is monitored, by the way, his private email account -- so that it -- that traffic is appropriately captured and
 

archived in the system. And he insists himself on using his state.gov primarily for his work. But it is impossible to completely take off the table the fact that some people send him emails on his private account.
QUESTION: Right.
MR KIRBY: The same happens to me.
QUESTION: Is he --
QUESTION: Who monitors that? Is that the Russians --
MR KIRBY: There's somebody on --
QUESTION: -- or the Chinese?
MR KIRBY: There's somebody on our staff who --
QUESTION: Gets copied in every single email?
MR KIRBY: -- monitors his personal email account so that --
QUESTION: Do you have --
MR KIRBY: -- it can be properly -- so that those emails can be all properly captured.
QUESTION: But to Matt's point, I mean, are there concerns about the security of his private email? Are there extra measures taken?
MR KIRBY: I won't get into security measures, but I think you can safely assume that we take email security, particularly his, very, very, seriously. But I won't get into publicly discussing --
QUESTION: Even within his -- but even within his private account? We know his state.gov presumably would have securities, but what about his private email? Do you take extra measures there?
MR KIRBY: There's -- of course, appropriate security measures are taken, but I won't go into detail beyond that.
QUESTION: All right. But you said that Secretary Kerry's use of private emails fit -- it's compliant with the Department's rules and regulations, correct?
MR KIRBY: Correct.
QUESTION: Isn't that -- that's the same position that the Department had about Secretary Clinton's use of private --
MR KIRBY: At the time --
QUESTION: -- at the time?
MR KIRBY: -- when she did it, it was in line with Department policy. Department policy has changed --
QUESTION: Gotcha.
MR KIRBY: -- and the Secretary is in compliance with the new policies.
QUESTION: Is he a day-to-day email -- does he email -- would you say he uses it every day?
MR KIRBY: The Secretary uses email regularly. I don't have a record of how many he sends or receives on a daily basis, but of course, he uses email regularly. Yeah. It's important to remember it's not -- it's not that you can't ever use personal email. It's that it has to be properly captured and archived, and to the degree possible, shifted over to the state.gov account for further work.
Yeah.
QUESTION: John, reportedly Qasem Soleimani visited Moscow last week, and I was wondering --
MR KIRBY: Who?
QUESTION: Qasem Soleimani.
QUESTION: The IRGC - 

QUESTION: Yeah.
MR KIRBY: Yeah. We've seen the reports. I'm in no position to confirm or deny that travel.
QUESTION: Yeah. And did Secretary Kerry send a letter to Senate Foreign Relation Committee on Iran deal saying that Iran is fulfilling its obligations under the international agreement --
MR KIRBY: This was a normal certification letter required by the Secretary to Congress that he submitted to Senator Corker. And it basically lays out that thus far, Iran has been compliant with the JCPOA, but it was a normal required certification letter.
QUESTION: When was it sent?
MR KIRBY: Yesterday.
QUESTION: And are you releasing it publicly or --
MR KIRBY: I don't know of plans to release it publicly.
Yes.
QUESTION: Can I change the topic? Cuba? Cuba yesterday, they talk about the civil aviation. Do you have any comments on that and the diplomatic relationships?
MR KIRBY: Well, as you know -- and we've released a media note about this today -- so we did reach bilateral agreement to establish scheduled air services between the two countries. It's going to continue to allow charter operations, which exist now, and establish some scheduled air service, which will help facilitate an increase in authorized travel -- and you know we've talked about the kinds of travel that is authorized and that which is not -- which will enhance traveler choices and help, as we believe, to promote people-to-people links between Cuba and the United States.
So it's an important step forward in the normalization process, but it is just one step. There are many more steps to come, obviously. So we welcome this agreement and look forward to seeing it get into effect.
QUESTION: Thank you.
MR KIRBY: Yeah.
QUESTION: Could I have a quick question on Iraq? There was a phone call today between Vice President Biden and Haider Abadi, where they both welcomed Turkey's pulling back its forces from Iraq. Can you confirm that the forces are actually being pulled back?
MR KIRBY: I, as you know, am not going to speak to military matters, Said.
QUESTION: Okay.
MR KIRBY: I would simply point you to what the public record has been on this. And Turkey should speak to Turkish military units. That's not my place to do that.
But as I've said before, since the very beginning, we've urged the dialogue between Turkey and Iraq to work this out bilaterally, and we're encouraged by the dialogue that has continued to occur between the two countries on this issue.
QUESTION: John, on this topic, are you in touch with Turkey that their base in north Iraq was attacked by ISIL yesterday, and reportedly at least four Turkish soldiers were injured?
MR KIRBY: I'm sorry. I don't have an operational update for you on that. I'll take one more.
Laura.
QUESTION: Still on Turkey, there's some early reporting that a planned attack on the U.S. consulate in Istanbul was thwarted, that there were some arrests made. Do you have anything on that? Is that something that the U.S. participated in at all?
MR KIRBY: I can't speak to specific security and intelligence matters. You saw that there were a series of security messages we put out last week both in Ankara and Istanbul. We're working closely with Turkish authorities on these security threats. We wouldn't have issued those messages if we didn't have reason to do that. Obviously, security is a paramount concern. We take it very seriously, and we're going to continue to work with Turkish authorities as they work through examining these threats. But I won't go -- I can't go into any more detail than that.  

QUESTION: But you can't say whether that threat's been resolved? Because it sounds like maybe there's been some activity. MR KIRBY: I can tell you we're always vigilant; we must always be vigilant for terrorist threats. And beyond that, I'm really not at liberty to go. Thank you, everybody.

Dec 15, 2015 (Liberian Observer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- STATEMENT OF HIS EXCELLENCY BABATUNDE OLANREWAJU AJISOMO, SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ECOWAS PRESIDENT IN LIBERIA, AT THE INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS DAY CEREMONY, ""OUR RIGHTS, OUR FREEDOM ALWAYS"", MONROVIA, LIBERIA, 10TH DECEMBER 2015.
Your Excellencies, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,
I feel privileged and honoured to be asked to deliver this Statement on the International Human Rights Day. I am therefore immensely grateful to the organizers of this event for the opportunity.
As you are all aware, the respect for human rights lies at the core of our collective existence and the very essence of our humanity. In the history and trajectory of a nation, there is an inextricable link between the respect for the fundamental human rights of its people and the level of its national development.
When the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris exactly sixty eight years ago, to ensure the universal protection of the dignity of all human beings, it became the minimum standard for relations between humanity, between the governed and the governors, between people of all races, religion and creed. Personally, I marvel at the simplicity yet profoundness of Article 1 of the Declaration. I quote ""all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood""! (End of quote).
Distinguished Ladies and gentlemen, to appreciate the weight and importance of the content of the Universal Declaration, we must take our minds back to the heroic and sacrificial acts of distinguished personalities such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Mahatma Ghandi, Madam Rosa Parks of the Montgomery bus fame, Madiba Nelson Mandela, and Aung Sung Sun Kyi, Mother Theresa, all members of the human rights global Hall of Fame, who represent the struggle against the oppression of human beings and committed their entire lives to the struggle for the emancipation of their people and for humanity in general. Their calls for freedom for everyone and the struggles and deprivation that they have had to endure, sometimes resulting in the payment of the ultimate price, must cause us to reflect and appreciate the importance of freedom for humanity across the world.
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, the history of Liberia itself was founded on the very essence of liberty. The forefathers of this great nation left the predictable comfort of the United States of America in the early 19th Century to return home to the land of their forefathers. They placed emphasis on the dignity of the Black race and worked hard to make Liberia a home to all Africans. In spite of their laudable efforts at making Liberia a safe haven for all Africans, we must be true to ourselves in admitting that the prolonged inequality in Liberian society was largely responsible for the serious strains in society, which eventually led to the epochal events such as the 1979 'Rice Riots', the 1980 coup d'etat which ushered in the military regime of the late President Samuel Kanyon Doe, and eventually, the protracted civil war of 1989-2003. Several hundreds of thousands of West Africans have had to pay the ultimate price for restoring freedom and democracy to Liberia. History will definitely be kind to the initiative of the ECOWAS Authority to establish the ECOWAS Ceasefire Monitoring Group in Liberia (ECOMOG) in 1990.
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, as you will all recall, the outbreak of civil wars on the African continent coincided with the end of the Cold War in the late 1990s and like wildfire, ravaged a significant part of the African continent. For us in West Africa, the outbreak of violent conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau, and later in Cote d'Ivoire, as unfortunate as they were, made ECOWAS to reassess its efforts towards regional integration. Founded in May 1975 for the purpose of fostering economic cooperation between its Member States, ECOWAS, as a result of the aforementioned, however had to, in the early 1990s; adopt a 'security-first' approach to regional integration. It became clear from the late 1990s that for ECOWAS to achieve the goals of economic integration and prosperity in West Africa, it must first and foremost achieve
 

a peaceful and stable region guided by the key principles of fundamental human rights and democracy and good governance. This made ECOWAS to prioritize the entrenchment of democracy and good governance across the region. As you all know, democracy and good governance and human rights are identical twins. Where one is found, the other must also reside. The foregoing therefore means that we must carefully nurture good governance and democracy in West Africa and in Liberia in particular.
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, the adoption of the Protocol relating to the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management, Resolution, Peace Keeping and Security in 1999, the adoption of the Supplementary Protocol on Democracy and Good Governance of 2001, and the ECOWAS Conflict Prevention Framework in 2008 by the ECOWAS Authority, have helped to ensure that minimum standards on democracy, good governance and human rights, are complied with by ECOWAS Member States. The articles and sections of these aforementioned frameworks have served as the Holy Grail for good democratic practice in West Africa today.
Specifically on human rights, the ECOWAS Conflict Prevention Framework (ECPF), a normative instrument which has as its core aim the strengthening of the human security architecture in West Africa has fifteen components that are being implemented across the region at the Member State, ECOWAS Commission and Civil Society levels. Indeed, the ECPF has a specific component on Human Rights and the Rule of Law. Deriving from the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, the Human Rights and the Rule of Law component of the ECPF seeks ""to ensure equal protection and access to justice and social services for all before the law, and strengthen the institutions of human rights and justice in the region..."" (ECPF, 2008: 33). Through the medium of the ECPF, ECOWAS seeks to facilitate the harmonization of policy and practice with regards to human rights, the rule of law and access to justice. ECOWAS also seeks to facilitate the adoption, reform and enforcement of national constitutions and human rights instruments to promote human rights, access to justice and social services for all. The operationalization of the ECPF will therefore go a long way in advancing human security in West Africa.
Another very important vehicle through which ECOWAS drives its regional human rights agenda is the Network of National Human Rights Institutions (NNHRI) which is a body whose membership comprises ECOWAS Member States National Human Rights Institutions. The Network's Secretariat is situated in Abuja, Nigeria and it meets annually to review the human rights situation in Member States and to proffer responses to threats to human rights. Members of the Network are tasked with ensuring that human rights are mainstreamed into government policies and decisions. West African civil society organizations are active participants at the Network's meetings where they usually present their own perspective on human rights issues and either affirm or contest the reports of the national human rights institutions.
Human Rights and Democracy: The Keys to Attaining Sustainable Peace and Stability in Liberia.
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, it is proven that in societies where democracy, good governance and human rights are respected, development is easily attained. Respect for diversity and the rights of people is important for growth and development for Liberia and the other fourteen ECOWAS Member States. In particular, protecting the rights of women and children is necessary for our collective well-being.
Despite the numerous challenges that it has faced since the end of the war and from the commencement of the President Johnson Sirleaf administration, Liberia has enjoyed a stable democracy and has become a place where people's rights are respected and diversity valued. We must ensure that going forward; people's rights are not denied them. More importantly, we must work assiduously towards strengthening our democratic institutions for this is the only way that we can actualize the Liberia of our dreams. We must ensure that the struggles of modern day heroes of Liberia such as the late Archbishop Michael Francis, Sheikh Kafumba Konneh, Ma Mary Brownell, Leymah Gbowee, Asatu Bah Konneh, Dr. Amos Sawyer, and several others, who dedicated their lives to the restoration of peace and stability in Liberia, must not be in vain.
Civil Society has a key role to play in ensuring that the rights of our people are respected by those in authority. Their role as the watchdogs and sources of alternative opinion on governance needs to be louder and clearer more than ever before. As we have achieved relative peace and stability in Liberia since 2003, the coming days are so crucial to the destiny of this great nation, Africa's oldest Republic. With the inevitable departure of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and the crucial presidential elections 2017, which will bring forth a new democratic dispensation, all eyes will be on Liberia from early next year. Indeed, we are entering a crucial year in the history of Liberia in a couple of days from now. All hands must therefore be on deck to ensure that Liberia never returns to the dark years.
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, let me assure you that the ECOWAS Commission remains committed, more than ever before, in ensuring that Liberia remains on the firm path to recovery and stability. The ECOWAS Commission has identified Liberia as one of the four ECOWAS Member States that will benefit from the pilot National Early Warning and Response Mechanism (NEWRM) that it is putting in place. ECOWAS is also making concerted efforts to maintain a permanent presence in Liberia by establishing an
 

Office of the Permanent Representative of the ECOWAS President in Liberia and in every ECOWAS Member State. Let me conclude by reiterating that we must ensure to safeguard our hard-earned democracy in Liberia. That way, the respect for human rights and the freedom of all can be guaranteed. Again, I would like to express my profound gratitude to the organizers of this important event for the invitation. I thank you also, distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, for listening. Liberia must rise again!",'The Imperatives of Human Rights and Good Governance in Liberia Now and in the Future' [document],All Africa AFNWS English

Obama Lifts US Sanctions on Liberia Ken Schwartz Last updated on: November 12, 2015 7:15 PM President Barack Obama lifted U.S. sanctions on Liberia Thursday. White House spokesman Ned Price cited what he calls Liberia's ""tremendous progress"" since emerging from civil war in 2003, including its commitment to democracy and development of political and economic institutions. ""Liberia has worked to overcome not only the scars of war but also the challenge of responding to an unprecedented outbreak of Ebola at a time when Liberians were in the middle of the vital work of consolidating democracy, building their economy, investing in infrastructure and strengthening their security services, Price said. But the White House says much remains to be done in Liberia, including transferring security responsibilities from a U.N. mission to Liberian forces next year, and a presidential election in 2017. ""Liberia and its people are up to these challenges,"" said Price. Former president George W. Bush imposed sanctions on Liberia in 2004, saying a peace deal and cease-fire ending the civil war was not being fully implemented. Bush also said Liberia was involved in arms trafficking and illegally lumber sales that were financing wars throughout West Africa. The sanctions targeted former top Liberian government officials and the family and close allies of former president Charles Taylor. Taylor set off Liberia's civil war in 1989, leading an uprising that toppled then-President Samuel Doe. Taylor was elected president in 1997, leading to a second civil war that ended when Taylor fled the country. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison in 2012 for instigating war and atrocities in neighboring Sierra Leone.",US Lifts Sanctions Against Liberia Ken Schwartz,America Press Releases 
26 October 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"26 October 2015 13:43 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Oct 26, 2015 (Liberian Observer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General (SRSG) and Coordinator of United Nations Operations in Liberia, Farid Zarif, has assured Liberians that the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) is not about to cut and run from the country. Rather, Mr. Zarif said UNMIL will still have 1,240 strong military personnel and 606 police officers on the ground after the June drawdown date.
UNMIL consisted of up to 15,000 United Nations military personnel and 1,115 police officers, along with a civilian component when it was established as a peacekeeping force in 2003.
The force would be used to assist the Liberian security forces in ""extreme situations,"" he said.
""UNMIL shall step in to help Liberia deal with any situation which would threaten a strategic reversal of the progress we have made together,"" Zarif assured.
He spoke at a reception that marked the 70th anniversary of the United Nations held at the headquarters of UNMIL last Thursday, in Monrovia.
The UN, he said, was born out of hope that a better world could be built, following the destruction brought about by World War II.
Mr. Zarif said the UN family came to the aid of Liberia, but working hand in hand with its leaders and people helped to maintain peace over the past 12 years, adding, ""This is an achievement we all should be proud of---the entire UN family, international partners, but most of all, Liberians.""
He said the UN Security Council recognized the achievement when it set the deadline of June 30, 2016, for Liberia to assume full responsibility for all aspects of its security.
The security of Liberia, he said, is also in the hands of Liberians themselves. But he expressed absolute confidence that Liberia's security will be able to meet those challenges as the UNMIL drawdown progresses.
The SRSG said the UN family will remain a strong partner of the Liberian people and together, will make progress on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which were recently adopted in New York.
He thanked President Sirleaf and the Liberian people for beating back Ebola, a disease that frightened the entire world, noting that the country was the worst hit in the region, but by mobilizing communities and pulling resources together, it succeeded in being the first to defeat this common enemy with help from the UN and other partners.
In her statement, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf reaffirmed government's commitment to implement UNMIL drawdown plans being fully cognizant of the security vacuum that will be created and the election challenges in 2017.
""Government reaffirms its commitment to the implementation of the drawdown plan and our own preparedness to take on the responsibility of peace and stability in our country,"" the President said.
She acknowledged the gap the departure of UNMIL will create, and the huge challenge the 2017 election poses, but said she remains confident that Liberia can take over its own security and manage it well.
President Sirleaf assured Liberians that government will count on the participation of every citizen to protect the hard earned peace, adding, ""Having enjoyed over a decade of peace as a result of efforts by the gallant men and women of UNMIL, Liberians are resolved to commit themselves to sustaining the peace even after UNMIL departs the country.""
 

She recounted Liberia's involvement with the formation of the UN, changing from the League of Nations to the United Nations in 1945, during its gathering in San Francisco, United States; noting that Liberia was always there as an active member. ""We tried to give a sober reflection on Liberia's involvement with the UN, through its diplomat, Angie Brooks Randolph (deceased), who later became the first African woman president of the UN General Assembly,"" the President said. The first woman President of the UN General Assembly was Madam Pandit of India. President Sirleaf then reminded the gathering of the importance of applauding the UN for its own internal achievements and its handling of crises around the world as well as its adoption of Resolution 1335 in support of women's rights during subsequent years. The President meanwhile thanked UNMIL for the significant role it played in driving the deadly Ebola virus disease from the country. UNMIL is a peace-keeping force established in September 2003 to monitor a ceasefire agreement in Liberia following the resignation of President Charles Taylor and the conclusion of the Second Liberian Civil War. It consisted of up to 15,000 United Nations military personnel and 1,115 police officers, along with a civilian component. It superseded the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL). The UNMIL force is being gradually withdrawn but will retain at least 1, 240 military personnel through the 2017 elections as disclosed by the SRSG Zarif. The reception ceremony was graced by senior government officials and representatives of diplomatic missions in Liberia, among others.","Unmil to Maintain 1, 240 'Strong' Force Until 2017 Elections

9 October 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"9 October 2015 15:07 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved London, Oct 09, 2015 (Thomson Reuters Foundation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Women in South Sudan have suffered unprecedented levels of sexual violence in the last two years, including abduction, rape, forced marriage and murder as civilians became targets of merciless ethnic warfare, the head of the Red Cross mission there has said.
""We went to one village to distribute aid and (our teams) were told they had been attacked some days earlier and 90 women had been abducted. After several days only about 60 of them came back,"" said Franz Rauchenstein, the outgoing head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation.
The latest turbulent chapter in South Sudan's four years of independence erupted in December 2013, after a power struggle between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy, Riek Machar, revived tensions between Kiir's Dinka and Machar's Nuer people.
The tensions led to a civil war that has threatened to spill over into the wider East African region, despite successive ceasefires.
Rauchenstein, 53, who began his posting in April 2014, said he had been shocked by the intensity of the looting and violence that have put traditional livestock herding at risk and driven millions to the brink of starvation in the drought-prone region.
""Civilians have been directly targeted. The people are collateral damage of the attacks. Houses are burned, properties destroyed and so the people are literally running for their lives,"" Rauchenstein said in an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation in London.
""What is new in this conflict is that women have been attacked while they have been seeking refuge on the islands,"" said Rauchenstein, referring to the remote hideouts in swamps where traumatised civilians hide during attacks.
""Those who are abducted may be forcefully married, enslaved or killed,"" Rauchenstein said.
Both parties to the conflict have committed violations of international humanitarian law and gross human rights abuses, including mass killings, rape and other forms of sexual violence, Amnesty International reported in August.
Human rights groups have also pointed to cases of gang rape, of pregnant women being cut open and of women being raped using wooden sticks or plastic bottles.
FOCUS ON HUMANITARIAN LAW
The ICRC, a neutral actor in conflict zones, has not commented on who is to blame, preferring to train the warring sides in humanitarian law, urging them to halt attacks on civilian populations to allow aid distribution to continue.
""The danger is that when you gather 1,000 families for a food distribution, people move with their cattle. This risks attracting the warring parties, so it's a race against time - we have to ensure we are not adding to the problem,"" said Rauchenstein, who has also led ICRC missions to Liberia, Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
""After a (cattle) raid we have asked the population 'were we to blame?' and they said no, the looters would have come anyway.""
 

Reaching civilians is hampered by the way feared rebel factions, such as the White Army - made up largely of Nuer youths who dust their bodies with ash - merge with the communities, farming by day and fighting by night, aid workers have reported. Rebel spokesmen have denied in the past that the White Army was controlled by Machar. Kiir and Machar signed an internationally brokered peace accord in August, in a bid to end the violence, with Machar due to become First Vice President as part of the deal, but it has not halted the atrocities. In the nothern town of Leer, in oil-producing Unity State, armed robberies forced the ICRC and medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) to suspend activities earlier this week. ""It is lucky nothing happened to our team,"" said Rauchenstein. He said the crisis had affected his staff in other areas too. ""In May, two of our staff were hiding with their families in the swamps. When we finally managed to evacuate them in July they were totally emaciated and must have lost 10 kilogrammes. It was very shocking,"" Rauchenstein said. Gathering testimony from victims is difficult, with women fearing they will be stigmatised if they admit to being raped, said Rauchenstein, who has now completed his South Sudan mission. ""The challenge is to get women to come to sexual violence support services in clinics and hospitals where they can feel supported,"" he said. - Reporting By Tom Esslemont, editing by Tim Pearce","Scale of South Sudan Sexual Violence Is Unprecedented - Red Cross

Sep 22, 2015 (The Inquirer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The political leader of the main opposition Liberty Party (LP), Cllr. Charles Walker Brumskine, has called on Liberians to remember the predominance of good governance in peace-building.
Speaking yesterday at the World Peace Day Program of the Center for Peace Education in Liberia, Cllr. Brumskine reminded the citizens that to build and maintain peace, it is not enough to construct police stations, train more police and/or improve budgetary allotment to the security sector.
Cllr. Brumskine added that while those are critical to maintaining the peace, peace-building is likely to fail if it is detached from the broader political strategies of Reconciliation, Reform, Recovery, and Rebuilding.
""We emphasize that we must create the right political space in order for key peace-building interventions to gain traction. We must also strengthen our justice system throughout the country and ensure that there is equal protection under the law for all of our citizens, as guaranteed by the Constitution of Liberia,"" Brumskine who has contested for the Liberian Presidency twice intimated.
He noted that building and preserving peace are important for all adding, ""We have learned from our national experience of the grave consequences of conflict on a nation and its people. Our national experience, therefore, compels us not only to celebrate peace today, but also to remind us of the need to incorporate into our national political arrangement, continuous dialogue, inclusive government, fair distribution of the nation's resources, access to education for all children, readily available healthcare, and merit-based employment opportunities.
Cllr. Brumskine said these are things that will positively impact the lives of the people and sustain the peace.
""We believe that if we align security, development, and governance into a coherent and integrated strategy, then building and sustaining the peace would become more than an event that we celebrate; they will be a journey that we all take together. The United Nations and our development partners have assisted us in laying the foundation, upon which we must now proceed; we must take ownership of the peace process, and move it forward in sustainable and transformative ways,"" he stated.
Speaking further, the Liberian lawyer-turned politician noted, ""All Liberians should have a shared commitment to ensure enduring peace in our country; never again allowing a breach of our national peace. So the Liberty Party and I will continue to be a voice for dialogue, understanding, and tolerance among all Liberians, irrespective of religion, ethnic background, political persuasion, or social class. For, in the final analysis, we are yoked together for as long as we inhabit this small country called Liberia. We breathe the same air; we all cherish our children's future; and we all bleed, hurt, and die.""
He said peace does not exist in a vacuum noting, ""It struggles to exist where there is abject poverty; an unfair distribution of the nation's resources; where preventable diseases become debilitating, resulting into death; and where one cannot exercise his or her God-given rights because he or she lacks the basic education that would inform each of what his or her rights are.""
He said,"" Liberia has to deal with the issues of poverty, relative greater underdevelopment in some regions of the country, absence of roads, especially during this time of the year, such that large segments of the population are disconnected from the rest of the country, lack of access to education for all of our children, non-existence of employment and business opportunities for many Liberians, and pitiable or no healthcare.""
Among other things, he said, ""We will also have to tackle more effectively the insidious tax known as corruption, by which the poor is deprived by the wealthy of basic social infrastructure, and ensure that every Liberian has a shot at being the best that he or she can be,"" Brumskine pointed out.
 

WORLD PEACE DAY ADDRESS (Delivered at the World Peace Day Program of Center for Peace Education in Liberia)
by Charles Walker Brumskine
Salutations!
I am honored, and would like to thank the Center for Peace Education for having selected me as your guest speaker for Liberia's celebration of the International Day of Peace, also known as World Peace Day.
The logo of the International Day of Peace carries the white dove, similar to that of the Liberty Party, which makes me feel an even more significant part of this occasion.
In 2013, for the first time, this day was dedicated by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to Peace Education, the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably. And it is noteworthy that the Center for Peace Education, a non-governmental organization, has committed itself to developing ""a comprehensive peace building program in Liberia by teaching mediation and conflict resolution as a means of achieving harmony and a better life for future generations."" For this I commend you.
World Peace Day is observed annually on September 21. Although this day is dedicated to world peace, events of World Peace Day are sometimes used in a narrow sense to recognize the absence of war and violence in a given situation or in a specific country, such as might be occasioned by a temporary ceasefire in a combat zone for humanitarian aid access, or what may appear to be permanent cessation of hostilities, but without the basics for sustaining the peace.
To inaugurate World Peace Day, the United Nations Peace Bell is rung at UN Headquarters, as ""a reminder of the human cost of war."" We, Liberians, have known our unequal share of the human cost of war. So today, as we join millions around the world in celebrating World Peace Day, I call upon every Liberian to realize that peace is not simply the absence of war, and that lasting peace will be ensured by the reconciliation of our people, and the establishment of a political environment that will continue to foster peace in our country--a political environment created by the election of national and local leaders who have demonstrated the wherewithal, and who have the capacity to maintain peace and ensure stability in our country.
Liberians cannot continue to see wrong and call it right, and treat that which is right as if it were wrong!
Peacebuilders, my young friends, and fellow Liberians, we may have as many programs, as we can in celebration of World Peace Day, engage as many orators and speakers, as may lend their voices; the truth of the matter, however, is that we remain at risk until we consolidate our efforts toward addressing the issues that would make a difference in the life of every Liberian.
We may join others around the world and release a billion white doves, and ring the United Nations Peace Bell until we are deafened by the sound; but hear this: for every child on the street peddling chewing gums and candies, when he or she should be in school; for every mother that dies in childbirth because her village remains without rudimentary health facility; for every father, who embarrassingly is unable to provide for his family, because there is no employment opportunity or he has not been helped to shift from subsistence to commercial farming, or to start a business; for elderly Liberians, for whom their twilight years have become years of pain and suffering, because we have not found the way to grandfather them into the social welfare system, there is no peace for them!
Yes, symbolism is great, especially in politics. But it is time that Liberia moves away from the dimension of politics that concerns itself with only getting elected, to the breadth of politics that addresses the issues that would enhance the welfare of the total human being.
Peace does not exist in a vacuum; it struggles to exist where there is abject poverty; an unfair distribution of the nation's resources; where preventable diseases become debilitating, resulting into death; and where one cannot exercise his or her God-given rights because he or she lacks the basic education that would inform each of what his or her rights are.
Liberia, therefore, has to deal with the issues of poverty, relative greater underdevelopment in some regions of the country--absence of roads, especially during this time of the year, such that large segments of the population are disconnected from the rest of the country, lack of access to education for all of our children, non-existence of employment and business opportunities for many Liberians, and pitiable or no healthcare. We will also have to tackle more effectively the insidious tax known as corruption, by which the poor is deprived by the wealthy of basic social infrastructure, and ensure that every Liberian has a shot at being the best that he or she can be.
The future of peace and stability of our country also hangs on whether we invest enough in opportunities for our youth, enabling them to play a meaningful role in shaping their future. Our country has a large generation
 

of adolescents, but they are a generation that stands less educated than their parents; an unfortunate consequence of our civil war. These young people have hopes and dreams, knocking on doors to be opened to them so that they may produce a demographic dividend for Liberia, as never before. On the other hand, if they are left unemployed and idle, their pent-up energy could be disruptive for the nation. We should know that we neglect the young people at the peril of our national peace.
If our nation is to take hold of the theme of your celebration, ""Moving forward with peace and leaving Ebola behind,"" Liberia will have to embrace the broader definition of health, which focuses government programs on the true causes of ill health such as poverty, poor nutrition, inadequate housing, and unsafe drinking water, among others. This approach to health results in a global as well as an individual outcome. I was, therefore, pleased to have read in one of the local dailies that President Sirleaf has submitted to the Legislature a Bill for restructuring the Ministry of Health for the purpose of making the ""Ministry more responsive in providing affordable and better quality health care.""
Building and preserving peace is important for all. We have learned from our national experience of the grave consequences of conflict on a nation and its people. Our national experience, therefore, compels us not only to celebrate peace today, but also to remind us of the need to incorporate into our national political arrangement, continuous dialogue, inclusive government, fair distribution of the nation's resources, access to education for all children, readily available healthcare, and merit-based employment opportunities. Those are things that will positively impact the lives of the people and sustain the peace.
We must further remember the predominance of good governance in peace-building. To build and maintain peace, it is not enough to construct police stations, train more police and/or improve budgetary allotment to the security sector. While those are critical to maintaining the peace, peace-building is likely to fail if it is detached from the broader political strategies of Reconciliation, Reform, Recovery, and Rebuilding. We emphasize that we must create the right political space in order for key peace-building interventions to gain traction. We must also strengthen our justice system throughout the country and ensure that there is equal protection under the law for all of our citizens, as guaranteed by the Constitution of Liberia.
We believe that if we align security, development, and governance into a coherent and integrated strategy, then building and sustaining the peace would become more than an event that we celebrate; they will be a journey that we all take together. The United Nations and our development partners have assisted us in laying the foundation, upon which we must now proceed; we must take ownership of the peace process, and move it forward in sustainable and transformative ways.
All Liberians should have a shared commitment to ensure enduring peace in our country; never again allowing a breach of our national peace. So the Liberty Party and I will continue to be a voice for dialogue, understanding, and tolerance among all Liberians, irrespective of religion, ethnic background, political persuasion, or social class. For, in the final analysis, we are yoked together for as long as we inhabit this small country called Liberia. We breathe the same air; we all cherish our children's future; and we all bleed, hurt, and die.
Therefore, I would like to challenge all Liberians, whether you are in this audience, listening to me by radio, or watching this program on TV, to join me in extending a hand to someone who any of us may have offended, intentionally or inadvertently, and say, ""my friend, nu-mah yah (kindly pardon my transgression); let us start anew and build a peaceful relationship.""
Peacebuilders, my young friends, and fellow Liberians, let us together shout aloud the inscription on the side of the United Nations Peace Bell, ""Long live absolute world peace."" And we may add, long live absolute peace in Liberia.
I thank you!","Brumskine Outlines Conditions for Peace

Sep 18, 2015 (The Analyst/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The Liberian Council of Churches (LCC) has been a critical moral voice in the decadent governance journey of Liberia. Besides providing social services to the Liberian populace, the LCC has also been playing a peace-making role as was the case during the 14-year civil conflict when the Church persistently participated in brokering various peace agreements that eventually led to the cessation of hostilities and the resumption of democratic rule in 2003. But if the church feels that its traditional service-providing and peace-making roles make it the true moral voice and major stakeholder in the eye of the spokespersons of the Sirleaf administration, then it has made a fatal mistake. For the folks down at MICAT are particularly ruthless indiscriminately when their redline-the image of Government-is put under scrutiny even deservingly is crossed.
LCC crossed the redline of Minister Lewis Brown and his MICAT battalion with its Ecumenical Letter which raised concerns about alarming education, health and other critical issues in the country. The Analyst reports.
This month's issuance of its Ecumenical Letter has proven fatal for the Council of Churches, which has come under virulent repudiation from the Ministry of Information. In fact the Minister, Lewis Brown, has discredited the Church's standing in the Liberian society regarding its moral and social-service roles.
The Church's letter comes amid huge discontent among Liberians regarding government's poor performance in delivering basic social services to the people.
This is what the Church wrote in the Letter
The Liberian Council of Churches wishes to thank the Government of Liberia especially for the fight against the deadly Ebola Virus Disease that plunged our Nation for over one year as well as some infrastructural development including road rehabilitation across the Country. The Council also recognizes the enormous financial and material contributions that the International Community and partners continue to make towards the improvement of livelihood for the people.However, in the wake of these gains and achievements by the Government, and the contributions from partners, the Council is seriously concern about several key issues that need immediate attention by the Government to improve the livelihood of the citizens.Following several internal engagements with government regarding these issues of national concerns, the government has exerted minimal efforts to address them in order to ensure that the livelihood of the citizens are improved, The Liberian Council of Churches (LCC) strongly expresses its frustration and dashing hopes in the manner and form in which the government is handling these issues.
1. Corruption:
President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, during her first inaugural address to the nation, promised the citizens and the world - that corruption would be the ""Number One State Enemy"". Contrary to this promise, the President in one of her addresses to the Nation informed the Nation that corruption has become a vampire to the state. The reality of this first statement and encouraging promise to the people is yet to be actualized and proven. The Nation and people continue to suffer from the ills of rampant corruption in the hands of entrusted public officials. The LCC representing the Conscience of the Liberian people is calling for stern and tougher actions to be taken against corrupt government officials without fear or favor.
2. Messy Education System:
At this moment in time in our Nation, human resource development is an imperative priority for future growth, development and peace. Before the war, the government subsidized private schools and made concrete efforts to improve the standards of public schools. Many schools were equipped with good library and laboratory. Students' academic outputs were in comparison to international standards. Now, an admission by the Government that the educational system is ""messy"" is a concern that must be seriously addressed. Immediate efforts must be taken by the Government to turn the ""mess"" to ""best"". Similarly, the LCC is also concern about the recent increase in tuition at the University of Liberia based on inadequate budgetary
 

allocation to the University; and the subsequent reactionary plan by the students to demonstrate against this decision. We however welcome the recent move by government to make sure that the good that was turned to ""mess"" is restored.
3. Poor Health System:
The Ebola Virus Disease exposed the extreme weakness of the health system and the poor service delivery. This revelation MUST BE CONSIDERED as a WAKE UP CALL for the Government to begin improving the conditions at the various hospitals, health centers and clinics including health workers. The GOVERNMENT MUST ACT NOW! The Liberian people deserve the best from their Government. It is the right of the people to good health.
4. Poverty:
From International and National sources, most citizens of Liberia live below One United States Dollar a day. Amidst this stunning reality, prices of basic commodities continue to increase. Additionally, the wage disparity between the affluent and poor is very huge leaving the nation without a middle class. Basic social services including access to safe drinking water, electricity, good roads and sanitation even in the urban areas and immediate environs are inadequate. In the wake of the slow infrastructural and economic development for the improvement of livelihood for the citizens, fringe benefits and personnel expenditures for the very few minority in Government account for over 50% of the National Budget. The LCC regards these actions by the Government as being less sensitive to the interest of the citizens.
Conclusion:
The LCC is, as it has always done, calling on the Government of Liberia to ensure that the promises made by it to improve the livelihood of the citizens are upheld and actualized. We call on the Government to take tougher and resolute actions to fight corruption, and put the interest of its citizens first. We call on government to work harder to reconcile the Liberian people. As a partner to the Government, the Council will always avail itself to work with Government and major stakeholders including the International Community and International partners for the promotion of peace, reconciliation, and the improvement of livelihood for the people of Liberia.
MICAT Response
Last week, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf met with ranking members of the Liberian Council of Churches. The meeting which focused on the foundation of the Republic on Christian principles proved to be enlightening for all concerned. Hours later, through various media reports, the government became aware of an ecumenical letter from the Liberian Council of Churches over the signature of its President, Most Reverend Jonathan B.B. Hart, drawing attention to issues of corruption, education, health and poverty issues that are inextricably linked and with which the government is seriously concerned and endeavoring to comprehensively address.
The Liberian Government views the Liberian Council of Churches as constructive partners in the ongoing process of transformation, and accordingly, entreats its positions with due respect and seriousness. However, we do not believe its recent public posture tells the whole story or accounts for the progress we have achieved together.
Corruption
Corruption remains public enemy number one. Describing corruption as a ""vampire"" is, once again, a reminder of the seriousness of this societal ill as well as the duty Liberians share to fight it everywhere - in the government, in the church, in various communities, in schools, and in our homes. Making the fight as inclusive as possible is how we will continue to be successful. There is no doubt that the Church is an enduring pillar of the Liberian State. This enviable position imposes a duty, perhaps more than on many other institutions of the Liberian society, to be enjoined with the government in ensuring the total health of the nation whose lifeblood corruption, the ""vampire"", is desperate to suck away. And so we continue to believe we can both do more.But the need to do more in the fight against corruption ought not to translate into an understanding by the Council that nothing has been done to fight corruption. In 2007, Liberia was included in the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index (CPI) Ranking. The CPI ranks countries of the world from least corrupt to most corrupt by objective measures of various independent organizations. In 2007,Liberia wallowed at the bottom ranking 150 out of 180 countries. In 2008, the country ranked 138 out of 180 countries. In 2009, Liberia advanced 41 places and ranked 97 out of 180 countries.
In 2010, the country ranked 87. In 2011, apparently distracted by the conduct of free and fair elections, Liberia ranked 91. In 2012, Liberia achieved its highest ranking and highest place of 75 out of 176 countries. In 2013, the country dropped eight places to rank 83 out of 177 countries and outperformed many of its neighbors and countries on the continent. According to the latest report for 2014, the difficult year of the  

Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak, Liberia ranks 94 out of 175 countries. This is the objective proof of the measure of progress in the fight against corruption.
Additionally, as has been widely reported, early next month, the country is poised to enter into Compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) from which the country is expected to benefit from a grant of USD256.7M to be largely invested in electricity and road maintenance, binding constraints to the growth of the Liberian economy, and by extension, major impediments in the efforts to improve the living conditions of our people. Under this Program of the United States Government to which Liberia has been engaged for at least three years, similarly-situated countries compete among-st themselves principally in areas of democratic governance and control of corruption to qualify for the much-needed grant. Liberia's continued success over the last three years is due in no small measure to its ability to consistently pass the scorecard on control of corruption which measures the country's efforts in fighting corruption against other countries similarly situated to Liberia.
Certainly the Council will agree that corruption is endemic - historically rendering all institutions of the society vulnerable to its cancerous embrace. This settled truth has therefore compelled two unavoidable consequences in the ongoing fight against the scourge: Firstly, that there is bound to be a perennial struggle between objective reality and popular perception about corruption. And secondly, that if we are to continue to succeed as we believe we can, then we must continue to fight corruption collectively, systemically and sustain-ably.
As to the struggle between objective reality and popular perception, the government continues to seek a useful balance by improving public awareness and exposing the stubborn facts of our collective progress always aware that public perception will not simply go away. Sadly, then, public posturing on this grave issue by venerated organizations such as the Liberian Council of Churches, in obvious disregard to the available objective evidence, can only fuel the inherited negative public perception about the ability of the society to wage a successful war against the ""vampire"". Worst still, it leaves the unfortunate impression that corruption exists only in the government, and that only the government has a duty to fight it. On either of these counts, the resultant effect is to publicly undermine the ongoing fight against corruption.As to fighting the public menace sustain-ably, the approach of the government has been to begin by deliberately and continuously addressing individual and institutional vulnerabilities including improving civil servants' salaries and capacities within available means as well as creating and reforming public institutions. Today, there are more integrity institutions than ever, and although we are still limited by the lack of capacities and resources to do all that we wish to, yet, in public procurement, for example, we have incorporated best international practices to ensure transparency, accountability and value for money. These individual and institutional safeguards are showing signs of bearing fruits across the public bureaucracy.
The truth also is that continuous audits are now a main feature of the management of public resources - an obvious departure from the past. Through the Public Accounts Committee of the Legislature or the Courts, as deemed necessary, we continue to hold public officials duly accountable for proved abuse of the public trust. As promised, and after much-needed reforms including to the jury law, the courts have begun to produce a number of indictments and convictions of public officials for corruption-related offenses. This has brought a sustainable whole-of-government approach to fighting corruption. Also, where it has been necessary to take immediate administrative actions, pending final resolution by the Legislature or the Courts, the Executive domain has consistently done so without fear or favor.
Another important measure of proven success in the ongoing fight against corruption is the growing sense of public awareness which has now been generated against corruption, and upon which both the State and the Church must continue to build. We celebrate this significant gain even though, in the interim, it makes for many unsubstantiated claims in the public space. But we believe this is a reasonable, albeit annoying, small price to pay in this important endeavor.Make no mistake: The fight against corruption is far from over. Throughout the ongoing efforts, we continue to remind ourselves that we are not where we know we can be. However, it is wrong for the Council to have ignored the changing reality of our circumstances, and to suggest, as it has, that nothing has been done to fight corruption.
Finally on this subject, we know the church to be a community dedicated to the spiritual and moral nurturing of its members. Today, many public officials are members of various churches in the country. Some are even serving in high positions of trust in the church. Either prior to entry into the government or while they are in the government, many of these public officials regularly fall under the moral and spiritual guidance of their clerics. To therefore suggest that the government has failed in the fight against corruption - that these same officials are somehow irredeemably corrupt - even if this were true and supported by available evidence, is to correspondingly admit the moral failing of the church for which the Council must also accept responsibility.
Education
Regrettably, we find the Council's position on the educational system to be wanting, and we refuse to believe that it is largely informed by the expressed need of the government to subject subsidies to private schools to
 

increased levels of accountability. At 5,181 schools, there are more school buildings constructed across the country than 'before the war', and at 1.1 million students, enrollments, especially of girls, exceed the pre-war periods. Obviously, here again, we do need to renovate and construct more buildings. But as the Council will agree, schools are more than buildings.
They include teachers, over a third of which are not qualified, with for instance, up to 70% of teachers in Sinoe being untrained. As the Council knows, war drains a nation of its brains, and in the case of Liberia, effectively removed the capacity to produce possible replacements. Especially as a result of this, we are seeing our children underperform in public examinations including the West African Examinations.
The government is equally concerned that many of our schools, including private schools, are failing our children. In fact, the evidence is that the public schools are outperforming the private which are largely faith-based. As the Council knows, it takes courage in leadership to call a problem for what it truly is. And so we did. However, we have not only called a problem, we are employing resources and capacities to faithfully address the problem.The government therefore encourages the Council's cooperation in achieving the announced reforms in the educational system so as to provide the best quality of education to our children. The time-bound objectives of the comprehensive plan of the government includes putting in place the foundations for a Liberian educational system that improves all students' learning by 2017, and seeing a significant improvement in children's learning outcomes and national literacy rates by 2020. This is why the recent action by a number of private institutions some of which are members of the Council to enroll their students in the WAEC Exams against the directive of the Ministry of Education is unhelpful.
Of course, we wish the Council had joined us in the meeting with the students and the administration of the University of Liberia. Perhaps its position on this serious matter would have been less cynical. Suffice to say that all stakeholders in quality education at the University of Liberia need to do more. We admit that the government needs to source the means to allocate more than the current USD15M to the University. The same is true that the administration needs to do more to improve the services and quality as well as to attract additional support, and the students need to do more to purchase the quality of education that is lacking. Not only is the cost of education at the University of Liberia the cheapest in the world, at LD175 per credit hour, compared to all other tertiary institutions which are dominantly church-owned, it is by far the cheapest in the country.
Finally on this subject, we can only encourage the Council to join us in these efforts, rather than assume an unenviable seat on the sidelines.
Health
It has been well-documented that in 2006, the country's health care system was anything but that with, for example, only 41% of the population accessing basic health care within 5km distance or one-hour walk, with 354 health facilities serving more than three million people and accounting for a population to health facility ratio of 1:10,500 persons. The country had 3,966 health workers of which 60% were unskilled staff while 46% of health facilities were managed by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Average salary for nurses was approximately LD800 or USD15 while medical doctors received USD30 or its equivalent in Liberian Dollars.Malaria prevalence rate was 66% as the country frequently experienced outbreaks of infectious diseases such as diarrhea, cholera and measles all of which are on the decline with malaria being reduced to 28% by 2012. In 2006, three counties had no functional hospitals and eight counties including River Gee, Grand Cape Mount, Grand Gedeh, Rivercess, Gbarpolu, Sinoe, Grand Kru and Maryland had no Liberian medical doctor to provide quality and comprehensive health services.
Prior to the EVD Outbreak, according to the WHO statistics, Liberia ranked among eight countries on the Continent to achieve under-5 mortality (MDG 4), from 194 in 2000 to 114 in 2009, recording the fastest rate of annual reduction on the Continent of 5.4%. These were achieved through a robust Public Health Care (PHC) Approach adopted by the government integrating immunization campaigns with deworming, Vitamin A supplementation as well as increasing the number of fully immunized children. By 2009, according to the MDG 2011 Report on Assessing Progress in Africa, seven African countries, including Liberia, were classified as ""best-performing in reducing Infant Mortality Rate by at least 50% between 1990 and 2009"". On account of these serious and sustained interventions, even while hosting refugees, since 2006, remarkably, Liberia has not experienced acute watery diarrhea and or cholera outbreaks anywhere in the country.Interestingly also, since 2009, physicians have increased by 30%, while the other three core health professionals have all increased by 50-60%. Each county now has at least one medical doctor with increase in salaries for nurses from USD15 to USD275, and for doctors from USD30 to USD1575. Functional health facilities have increased by 86% from 354 in 2006 to 657 in 2015, similarly increasing access from 41% to 71% in 2013. In 2006, the per capita health expenditure was USD3.3 per person compared to USD17.2 in 2013/14, excluding donors' funds. Importantly, since 2011, public health care services have been mandated to be free-at-point-of-use ensuring equitable access to health care by all Liberians.
 

There were many other notable and recorded improvements in the health sector since 2006 including the completion of two regional TB Laboratories at Phebe Hospital, in Bong County and the Liberia Government Hospital in Grand Bassa County as well as the provision of 61 clinics with solar panels in 2013. From budgetary allocation of USD10.9M in 2006, budgetary allocations to the Ministry of Health have been increased year-on-year including up to USD67.3M in 2012/13, and USD76.7M in 2014/15. Ranging from deliveries assisted by skilled provider and antenatal fourth visits for pregnant women to receipt of all basic vaccinations for children under the age of one as well as counseling and testing for HIV, the health sector, prior to the EVD outbreak, showed appreciable levels of improvements in service delivery to our people.Notwithstanding these accomplishments, experts are in agreement that the size and scale of the Ebola outbreak we faced would have similarly collapsed the health systems of many countries and shatter their economies. But our commitment is to rebuild a more resilient system, as has already begun, with the help and support of our partners. Again, we do not claim to have had a resilient health system but we certainly had one which was capable of responding to usual ailments, and it had increased access for more Liberians. We will continue to rebuild the health system and in that process account for the possibility of outbreaks such as Ebola, which even more developed countries have themselves admitted, the world was unprepared for.
Poverty
Improving the welfare of our people is at the core of the purpose of this administration. This is why we continue to prioritize the infrastructure, especially electricity and roads, as the backbone to Liberia's economic growth and development. The harsh truth is that of Liberia's 10,000km of roads, only about 700km is paved. To pave the roads as we desire will cost USD2.2billion which the country does not have. However, within our means and with the support of our partners, we continue to open new access and pave more streets and highways in the country because the multiplying effect is to reduce the cost of living on our people. On Sunday, September 13, we dedicated one such project at the cost of more than USD8M to safely link the Township of Caldwell to Monrovia and as far as Kakata, in Margibi County.
The same is true about electricity and water. Although the government inherited zero operational public utility and social services in the country, all of which had broken down, been destroyed or looted, but for the disruptions caused by the EVD Outbreak, the country was on track to rehabilitate the Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant to complement other efforts at power generation and distribution across the country including in villages and towns which had never experienced such growing necessity to improvements in their living conditions since Independence. Access to safe drinking water by many Liberians has also been exponentially increased from zero when this administration came into office to at least 60 percent. Again, we are committed to doing more.Of course the wage bill has increased due in large measure to adjustments in the income of civil servants and bringing others including healthcare workers previously paid by NGOs onto the payroll. Notwithstanding the adjustments, admittedly, there still are inherited disparities in incomes for example between doctors and politicians to which we have already objected and are currently addressing.
We do not apologize that salaries of civil servants - increased from a minimum of USD15 in 2006 to a minimum of USD125 today - must always have first claim on the budget. However, by creatively adopting the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) budgeting, we have ensured that much-needed investments in public sector improvement projects intended to significantly address poverty are included and protected in the new medium term expenditure cycle. We have also introduced the County and Social Development Funds not only to increase outlays to the counties for their development but also to increase Liberians' participation in and ownership of the development of their villages, towns and counties.
The truth also is that under this administration, many of the inherited and challengingly high indices by which poverty is measured have been respectably, and in some cases, exponentially lowered. For instance, life expectancy in 2014 has improved to 60.6 years compared to 46 years in 1985. Each year since 2006, the country's human development score has increased from 0.33 in 2006 to 0.41 in 2014.
According to the latest report on Liberia Food Security Assessment, food consumption has improved over the last years. An indicative trend shows that 50 percent of the population had either poor or borderline food consumption in 2006. By 2010, this rate reduced to 41 percent. In 2012, the poor food consumption households represented18 percent of the population. Today, the households characterized by poor food consumption constitute 5 percent of the population. Liberians engaged in business and with access to micro-credits and financing have also increased.
At 175 out of 187 countries, no doubt Liberia remains a poor country. But we did not become poor yesterday or last week! Our historic failures to invest in education, health, agriculture, roads, electricity, and human capacity - to pursue the collective benefits of inclusive growth - especially in the best of times inevitably contribute to the poverty of any nation. Compound that with the total implosion of the Liberian State and up to 90 percent collapse in the productive sector of the economy, the greatest by any nation since World War II all of this just over a decade ago - as well as the complete overturn of the moral compass and it becomes easier to appreciate the remarkable resilience of the Liberian people and the achievements of their
 

government.Obviously, we are not overwhelmed by these accomplishments. We continue to strive to do more. But we believe that the ongoing efforts including increased public participation in national decision-making as well as programs of decentralization being diligently pursued will strengthen the foundations of change we have introduced - change in how we serve our people and provide them the tools they need to be lifted from the sinking pits of poverty. Again, we ask you to join us in these important undertakings and remain constructively involved.","MICAT In Heated Feud With Church -LCC Crosses 'Redline', Receives Bellicose Rejoinder",All Africa AFNWS English 
17 September 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"17 September 2015 17:59 Xinhua News Agency XNEWS English Copyright 2015. Xinhua News Agency. All rights reserved. UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- Determining that the situation in Liberia continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region, the UN Security Council on Thursday extended the mandate of the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) until Sept. 30, 2016. In the resolution adopted Thursday, the 15-nation body commended ""the cooperation between, and significant efforts of, the Government of Liberia and the UNMIL to plan and prepare for the June 30, 2016 security transition to the Liberian authorities."" Moreover, the council affirmed ""its expectation that the Government of Liberia will assume fully its complete security responsibilities from UNMIL no later than June 30, 2016,"" while encouraging member states and multilateral organizations to continue to provide technical and other assistance to the government of Liberia in this regard, said the resolution. With the Liberian government expected to take over the security responsibilities soon, downsizing UNMIL is one key element of the resolution. The council decided ""to decrease UNMIL's authorized military strength from 3,590 to 1,240 military personnel, which includes one infantry battalion and related enablers, by June 30, 2016,"" said the resolution. In addition, the council decided ""to decrease UNMIL's authorized police strength from 1,515 to 606 police personnel, which includes three formed police units, as well as immigration and police advisers, by June 30, 2016,"" it said. UNMIL was set up in 2003 to bolster a ceasefire agreement after a civil war killed almost 150,000 Liberians -- mostly civilians -- and forced some 850,000 others to flee to neighboring countries.

Sep 04, 2015 (FrontPageAfrica/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- On July 22nd, 2004, U.S. President George W. Bush, acting in unison with U.S. laws, the United Nations and the Comprehensive Accra Peace Accord on Liberia, in an Executive Order, noted that the actions and policies of former President Charles Taylor and some of his associates, ""in particular their unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and their removal from Liberia and secreting of Liberian funds and property, undermined Liberia's transition to democracy and the orderly development of its political and economic institutions and resources.
Similar Trend, US, UN
President Bush went on to note that the peace accord signed on August 18, 2003, and the related ceasefire had not yet been universally implemented throughout Liberia, and that the illicit trade in round logs and timber products was linked to the proliferation of and trafficking in illegal arms, which perpetuated the civil conflict and fueled and exacerbated other conflicts in the region. Thus, President Bush said he found that actions, policies and circumstances at the time constituted an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. Foreign policy and went on to order the freezing of assets for Mr. Taylor and all of his associates as the UN had done only a year earlier. President Bush's successor, Barack Obama has in each of the succeeding years of his presidency issued similar executive orders renewing the sanctions.
On Wednesday, the United Nation Security Council issued Resolution 2237 declaring that the individuals and entities on the 1521 Sanctions list immediately prior to the adoption of 2237 (2015) are no longer subject to travel and financial measures and their names have been removed from the Consolidated United Nations Security Council Sanctions List.""
The decision which appears to have been pushed by the government of Liberia was greeted with optimism by the government. ""The general government position to the U.N. has been that the sanction list, travel ban and assets freeze list should not be kept in full, that relevant information needs to be evaluated and to the extent that information will point to the lifting of sanctions or a ban on an individual, that the UN should do so. Liberia wants all its citizens and partners to be contributive of the peace and progress of the nation,"" Foreign Minister Augustine Ngafuan told FrontPageAfrica Wednesday.
The Ministe,r however ,clarified that it was the Liberian government's policy to push for assets freeze or travel ban, particularly in a case where an individual or individuals are no longer a threat to the peace and stability of the country. The irony of Wednesday UNSC decision is already raising concerns about the scope of the sanctions dissolution amid mounting speculations that international organizations are bracing for a massive war crimes effort to bring those responsible for the civil war to book for their respective roles.
Mr. Benoni Urey, a candidate for the Liberian presidency under the banner of the All Liberian Party (ALP); and one of many on the U.S. treasury listing; is hopeful that the U.S. will follow the footsteps of the UN in removing him and others from the list.
Taylor Fears; Urey's Predicament
""I regret that I was never able to get the United States to understand me. I was never able to get them to work with me, which is so essential for Liberia. No President of Liberia, no President can make it successfully unless he is online with Washington."" - Former Liberian President Charles Ghankay Taylor, in a Nigerian Television interview while in exile in Calabar, Nigeria
Urey, who had earlier told the Voice of America that he had written the U.S. government to remove the ban since it was based on U.N. sanctions that have now been lifted, is quite aware about the importance of any sign of strains with Liberia's adopted stepfather, the United States.
 

Taylor, with whom he had a close relationship acknowledged months after his departure from Liberia, in Nigerian Television interview that one of his greatest regrets was not getting the U.S. to understand him and being able to get America's blessing. ""I regret that I was never able to get the United States to understand me. I was never able to get them to work with me which is so essential for Liberia. No President of Liberia, no President can make it successfully unless he is online with Washington,"" Mr. Taylor told an interviewer.
Continued Taylor: ""Now I'm not the kind of guy that you can pick up the telephone and command. I don't take that. I did not take that from Washington then, even if I wasn't elected President, I will not take it. I'm not that kind. I'm not a coward. But I do believe a good America relationship is essential for any President of Liberia or that President will fail.""
Some of Mr. Urey's supporters, including noted Liberian economist and political scientist Mr. Samuel P. Jackson, like Mr. Urey, is confident that the U.S. will follow suit, basing his suggestion on the close proximity of the US Treasury Department sanctions and the UN restrictions which were dissolved this week.
Says Mr. Jackson: ""The UN Security Council includes the United States of America. I am confident that the USA will follow its own leadership in the council and delist any Liberian, including Benoni Urey, on the Specially Designated Nationals list of the US Treasury Department. I can say that we in the Urey 2017 Organization believe in American justice and we are confident that the Americans will do the right thing. We look forward to working with the American people, who have been our greatest ally in our country's history in moving towards more concrete trade and investment relations between the two countries.""
Besides Mr. Urey, many other Liberians and international players are included on the U.S. list and all shared billing with the previously-designated UN list.
Camp Urey Upbeat About US Sanction Ease
The US list includes former Finance minister Charles Bright, Victor Bout, a businessman and transporter of weapons and minerals and the subject of the Hollywood blockbuster Lord of War starring Nicolas Cage; Jenkins Dunbar, former Minister of Lands, Mines and Energy, Chief Cyril Allen, former Chairman of the National Patriotic Party, Randolph Cooper, former Managing Director of the Liberia Petroleum Refining Company, Mr. Gus Kouwenhoven, a Dutch businessman and President of the former Oriental Timber Company, Hotel Africa, Mr. Emmanuel Shaw and former Finance Minister Juanita Neal.
According to the U.S. Treasury Department, the former Liberian Regime of Charles Taylor Sanctions represent the implementation of multiple legal authorities. ""Some of these authorities are in the form of executive orders issued by the President. Other authorities are public laws (statutes) passed by The Congress. These authorities are further codified by OFAC in its regulations which are published the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Modifications to these regulations are posted in the Federal Register. In addition to all of these authorities, OFAC may also implement United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) with regard to the Former Liberian Regime of Charles Taylor Sanctions.""
Amid the similarities between the US Treasury Department listing and the dissolved UN travel and assets freeze, diplomatic observers are keen to see how the U.S. will respond in the coming days and the impact the decision would have on the outcome of the 2017 Presidential race.
For supporters of Urey, Wednesday's decision by the UN could trigger the spark some say is crucial to Urey's candidacy. ""We are pleased by this historic decision of the United Nations. Liberians are indeed breathing a sigh of relief in the wake of this. We are firmly confident that our valued American partners are assured of our commitment to the peace and stability of Liberia through our active involvement in the democratic process, and they too will soon act and they too will soon ensure that all Liberians are removed from all forms of sanctions,"" a Urey aide told FrontPageAfrica on condition of anonymity Thursday.
Lost in the optimism of Mr. Urey's supporters is the daunting task of a Presidential candidacy hinging much on the easing of sanctions and how much of a factor, his looming freedom from his association with former President Taylor will have on his quest for the Liberian presidency; albeit America's acceptance.","Dilemma - Will U.S. Follow UN of Lifting Taylor-Era Bans?

Sep 04, 2015 (FrontPageAfrica/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- ""With the adoption of resolution 2237 (2015) on 2 September 2015, the Security Council terminated the travel and financial measures set forth in paragraph 4 of resolution 1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) and the 1521 Sanctions list was, thereby, dissolved,"" the council declared.
Resolution 2237 continued: ""The individuals and entities on the 1521 Sanctions list immediately prior to the adoption of 2237 (2015) are no longer subject to travel and financial measures set forth in paragraph 4 of resolution 1521 (2003) and paragraph 1 of resolution 1532 (2004) and their names have been removed from the Consolidated United Nations Security Council Sanctions List.""
In July 2012, the council delisted seventeen former Taylor aides upon the request of the government of Liberia, ending nine years of isolation for those many believe were responsible, or stood idly and did nothing as scores of Liberians were maimed, tortured, killed and forced to flee their homeland during Taylor's reign of terror.
Those Delisted in 2012 included: Adolphus DOLO; Mrs. Belle DUNBAR; Mr. George DWEH; Mr. Edwin SNOWE; Mrs. Agnes Reeves TAYLOR; Mrs. Tupee TAYLOR; Mrs. Jewel HOWARD TAYLOR; Mrs. Myrtle Francelle GIBSON; Mr. Martin GEORGE; Mr. Cyril ALLEN; Mr. Randolph COOPER; Ms. Victoria REFELL; Mr. John T. RICHARDSON; Mr. Reginald GOODRIDGE Mr. Emmanuel SHAW; Mr. Sampson GWEN; Mr. Maurice COOPER.
In 2014, businessman Benoni Urey, currently a candidate for the Liberian presidency for the 2017 presidential elections was also removed from the list. On Wednesday, the names of the remaining figures on the list including the much-feared Benjamin Yeaten were removed. Others who were still lingering on the list until it was dissolved Wednesday included: Chief Cyril Allen, Former Chairman, National Patriotic Party, Mr. Charles Bright, Former Minister of Finance, Mr. Randolph Cooper, Former Managing Director of Roberts International Airport who was allegedly instrumental in the various violations of the arms embargo, Mr. Adolphus Dolo, former Senator, and Mr. George Dweh, former Suspended Speaker of the National Transitional Legislative Assembly (NTLA) Founding member of LURD.
Gov't Welcomes Decision, Says Foreign Minister
Mr. Augustine Ngafuan, Minister of Foreign Affairs told FrontPageAfrica late Wednesday, shortly after the UN decision that the government welcomes the decision which he says is in line with the government's policy for the UN to review existing circumstances and revisit the conditions which led to the sanctions being put in place.
Said Minister Ngafuan: Generally, the sanctions were imposed by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) through its 1521 committee. They had also established a Panel of Expert to review the sanctions. The Government of Liberia had taken a position that the list should not be set in stone to keep people on forever and that the UN should revisit the list when it finds people are no longer threat to the post-war peace. Since the war in 2003, Liberia has had two democratic elections; we have celebrated 10 consecutive years of peace and some people who may have been players in things that happened in the past, have transitioned to other things. So we are generally in support of the UN for reviewing its own actions and we will take the relevant steps. So we generally support the termination of the sanctions as we have done in the past when people from the Taylor era were delisted, including Mr. Benoni Urey, based on our recommendation.
Minister Ngafuan explained that the previous delisting that included Mr. Urey came from a plea from the government to the UN, telling the UN not to keep people stuck on the list forever. ""Since they have found that three is no relevance in keeping people on sanctions, we welcome that. We will continue to work with the UN to ensure that Liberia's security remains paramount through the UNMIL security plan and we remain supportive of the UN.
 

UN Periodically Reviews Sanctions
Minister Ngafuan recalled that when the UN sanctions committee visited Liberia in 2012, it was the general consensus the situations of those on the list needed to be updated. During that visit, the Chairman of the United Nations Committee established pursuant to resolution 1521 concerning Liberia in several meetings with state actors, sought inputs on the impact of the sanction regime on the peace and security of Liberia.
Dr. Susan Rice, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations who was also in Liberia in 2012 acknowledged at the time that the sanctions issue is reviewed periodically by the sanctions committee. ""We have had the opportunity to discuss briefly and of course the Chairman of the Sanction Committee visited the Country. We continuously review our sanction regime and this is no exception and when it relates to individuals who have been designated we do take a look periodically to determine whether those designations remain warranted and we will do that and continue to do that in this instance.""
While the sanctions on travel and assets have been dissolved, the council maintained the arms embargo on non-State actors in Liberia for nine months. The council also renewed for 10 months the mandate of the Panel of Experts that assists the so-called 1521 Committee on Liberia to monitor the sanctions, reducing the panel membership from two experts which it says, reflects the limitation of its purview to the partial arms embargo and the Government's progress in arms and border management.
The Panel of Experts on Liberia's final report (document S/2015/558) and the Secretary-General's letter of 31 July (document S/2015/590) noted progress in arms and ammunition management, but also highlighted weaknesses in State institutions, persistent gaps in the legal framework for the security sector, and porous borders vulnerable to trafficking. In Wednesday's resolution, the council urged the government of Liberia to take further steps to combat the illicit trafficking of arms and ammunition, prioritizing the timely adoption and implementation of an effective legal framework.
""The Government of Liberia had taken a position that the list should not be set in stone to keep people on forever and that the UN should revisit the list when it finds people are no longer threat to the post-war peace. Since the war in 2003, Liberia has had two democratic elections; we have celebrated 10 consecutive years of peace and some people who may have been players in things that happened in the past, have transitioned to other things. So we are generally in support of the UN for reviewing its own actions and we will take the relevant steps. So we generally support the termination of the sanctions as we have done in the past when people from the Taylor era were delisted, including Mr. Benoni Urey, based on our recommendation"" Foreign Minister Augustine K. Ngafuan
The council commended the Government of Liberia for responding effectively to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia and recognized in this regard, the resilience of the people and Government of Liberia, and its security institutions, especially the Armed Forces of Liberia and the Liberia National Police.
The council also affirmed that the Government of Liberia bears primary responsibility for protecting all populations within its territory from atrocities, and stressed that lasting stability in Liberia will require the Government of Liberia to sustain effective and accountable Government institutions, particularly in the rule of law and security sectors. ""Stressing the need for increased progress on security sector reform in Liberia in particular to ensure that Liberia's military, police and border security forces are self-sufficient, capable and adequately prepared to protect the Liberian people.""
""Underlining that the transparent and effective management of natural resources is critical for Liberia's sustainable peace and security, the council says it stands ready to terminate the measures imposed by paragraphs 2 (a) and (b) and 4 (a) of resolution 1521 (2003) upon its determination that the ceasefire in Liberia is being fully respected and maintained, disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and restructuring of the security sector have been completed, the provisions of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement are being fully implemented, and significant progress has been made in establishing and maintaining stability in Liberia and the sub-region,
The council added that once the Government of Liberia established transparent accounting and auditing mechanisms to ensure the responsible use of Government revenue to benefit directly the people of Liberia, it would consider modifying the measure imposed.
The dissolution of the sanctions regime will no doubt bring a sign of relief to many whose lives since the end of the civil war had been in limbo, unable to travel and unable to utilized wealth obtained during the Taylor regime. But even as the sanctions regime came to an end Wednesday, those figures are not yet out of the woods as a cloud of the U.S. Treasury Department sanctions still looms, a point Mr. Urey addressed in a recent VOA Daybreak Africa interview when he revealed that he has written the U.S. government to remove the ban since it was based on U.N. sanctions which have now been lifted. ""I forwarded an appeal to them that there is no merit to this based on the fact the Treasury list was created as a result of a U.N.-imposed sanction on us and the U.N. has lifted these sanction and other international organizations - the EU has lifted their
 

sanctions on me; Great Britain has lifted theirs; Canada has lifted theirs; France has lifted theirs. So we hope that the United States will do that soon,"" Urey said. HIGHLIGHTS OF UN SECURITY COUNCIL DECISION The UNSC Decides to extend the mandate of the Panel of Experts appointed pursuant to paragraph 9 of resolution 1903 (2009) for a period of 10 months from the date of adoption of this resolution to undertake the following tasks in close collaboration with the Government of Liberia and the Cote d'Ivoire Group of Experts: (a) To investigate and compile a final report on the implementation, and any violations, of the measures on arms as renewed by paragraph 1 above, including the various sources of financing for the illicit trade of arms, and on progress in the security and legal sectors with respect to the Government of Liberia's ability to effectively monitor and control arms and border issues; (b) To provide to the Council, after discussion with the Committee, a final report no later than 1 May 2016 on all the issues listed in this paragraph, and to provide informal updates to the Committee as appropriate before that date; (c) To cooperate actively with other relevant panels of experts, in particular that on Cote d'Ivoire re-established by paragraph 24 of resolution 2153 (2014); ""4.

3 September 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"3 September 2015 PNA (Philippines News Agency) PHILNA English (c) 2015 Philippines News Agency UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 3 -- The UN Security Council on Wednesday renewed the sanctions on Liberia for another nine months as it continues to constitute a threat to international peace and security in the region, despite significant progress. In a unanimously adopted resolution, the Security Council renewed a set of measures on arms embargo for nine months, and also extended the mandate of the panel of experts tasked with monitoring compliance with the measures for 10 months, beginning on Wednesday.

The council also urged the government of Liberia to take necessary and appropriate steps to ""establish necessary legal and administrative framework to combat the illicit trafficking of arms and ammunition,"" it said. The arms embargo and other sanctions were imposed by the Security Council more than a decade ago as a response to the continued civil war in Liberia, where warring parties were involved in illegal arms traffic and diamond trade. According to resolution 1521 which was adopted in 2003, the criteria for termination of these sanctions include a ceasefire in the country, completing disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and restructuring of the security sector, implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and making progress towards stability.

Aug 18, 2015 (The Inquirer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Liberia will clock twelve years of durable peace and stability tomorrow, August, 18, 2015--meaning twelve years, since the country returned from years of senseless carnage, devastation and savagery to the fresh dawn of peace, civility and stability.
As we gallantly usher into the day, I pen this little piece to congratulate fellow citizens on the attainment of twelve years of peace and stability, a milestone achievement we must collectively protect and never permit ourselves to gamble.
As we celebrate twelve years of peace, stability and civility, I would like to entreat and admonish fellow citizens that despite our hurts, pains dissatisfactions and political disagreements , we must do all to uphold our hard earned peace, for the maintenance of this peace underpins everything we hope and yearn for as a nation and people.
You all will recall, that it was on August, 18, 2003, the what seemed impossible but would later become a dream come through, the heart-warming Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA) was historically signed in Accra, Ghana by relevant Liberian political and war actors thus engendering the compelling and embracing cessation of a decade plus unwarranted and untold bloodletting.
The war decimated thousands of innocent Liberians and ruined the infrastructure of the nation to tatters--we are still striving to resuscitate from the horrible devastation inflated on the country as the nightmares continue to loom and plague us.
The famous signing of the Accra Peace Accord actually came after fifteen years of horror and calamity callously waged on us by our selves. Liberians crudely slaughtered one another in cold blood and ludicrously destroyed millions of dollars worth of infrastructure in a horde of dreaded and fierce gun battles across the country.
It is reported that over 250,000 people were painfully murdered by drugged combatants during the disgusting and horrific period of the crisis while thousands survived with terrible bullet wounds and others hands and legs amputated leaving them to grapple with physical disabilities and life-long trauma.
Despite the harsh differences, anguish and deep seated grudges, Liberians mustered the will and courage with the intervention of international partners led by the United Nations to meet face-to-face in Accra, Ghana and chat a course of peace. It was indeed a tall-order for the parties to agree firstly to a cease fire and subsequently reached a peace deal to unconditionally discontinue the decimation of innocent citizens.
The talks undesirably prolonged and Liberians became more despair, frustrated, doubtful and dejected back home.
In fact, many Liberians lost hope and heralded the notion that peace for their country was mere illusion and Liberia was on the brinks of perils and imminent extermination.
However, notwithstanding, Liberians across the peace table in Accra finally garnered the courage and faithfully agreed to discontinue terrorizing their own country and obnoxiously murdering and maiming their own people to the dismay of the international community.
The United Nations and other international partners as well as the host, Ghana all became frustrated and fatigued with the unreasonable posturing of Liberians at the peace summit--everyone taking hard ground, beating chests and grandstanding while 81 millimeter rockets from rebel controlled position landed on Liberians by the hours. Monrovia became a fearsome ghost town as no one knew his/her fate in the next hour that would come.
 

I am reliably told that at one of the sessions at the peace summit, a group of Liberian women courageously appeared and stripped themselves naked before actors at the table as a way of protesting and detesting the unnecessary delay to reach a final peace agreement while innocent Liberians were being killed and maimed back home.
That emotional spectacle, I am told became a game changer in the talks as the warlords and politicians began to show flexibility and reasonability that smoothed the way to a lasting peace the nation currently enjoys.
They reached a genuine deal named and styled; the ""Comprehensive Peace Accord or the CPA"". We are immensely pleased that this deal has worked for twelve consecutive years now.
In a formal program held in 2013 to mark and celebrate eleven years of peace, several prominent speakers attributed the decade of peace to the steadfast resilience, courage and faith of the Liberian people. They stated that it is the Liberian people who have said a resounding 'NO!' to war and have resolved never to study arm crisis any more but rather stay the course of peace and democracy.
It is worth mentioning however, that Liberians have since chosen the democratic path as a way of changing government and not by the barrels of the gun.
Since the signing of the CPA which started with an Interim Government that successfully managed the Country for two years and led the nation through a successful transition that witnessed the holding of credible democratic elections in 2005 followed by a second free and fair democratic election in 2011 that was peacefully and professionally conducted.
Additionally, several bi-elections have been held under cloud of peace and civility as well as the conduct of the 2014 critical Senatorial election that was successfully conducted to the satisfaction of the international community.
As I commend the Liberian people for this milestone achievement which has significantly redefined the country in the eyes of the global community, I extend profound appreciation to fellow citizens and all who stood and continue to stand by us in helping to achieve this twelve years of peace and stability--we certainly remain a grateful nation.
We all know that things are tough; that the socio-economic condition of the Liberian people is unjust and unbearable, but we must never allow ourselves to reverse to the days of doom.
I entreat and admonish all to resist and denounce anybody who attempts to undermine and shatter this enviable twelve years of peace. We must not and never tolerate anybody who devilishly endeavors to jeopardize this peace as doing so; would certainly undermines the gains we have made as a nation and people.
For it will be preposterous, shameful and demeaning of our image if we allow ourselves to relapse in another round of senseless bloodbath only to please the selfish political desire of certain ridiculous elements who only means to power is by instigating conflict and violence. We have endured enough!
Finally, we cannot celebrate twelve years of peace without paying somber tribute to all of our compatriots and foreign doctors that died on our soil during the raging and ravaging outbreak of the killer Ebola virus. For me, the deadly Ebola outbreak that decimated well over four thousand of our citizens was certainly another war waged on the country by an unknown enemy--this enemy came defiantly determined and crudely ready to annihilate the entire nation. The tragedy of the deadly Ebola virus will forever remain fresh on the minds of this generation.
I extend condolences to the bereaved families of all that sadly succumbed to the diabolical hands of this killer virus, and as we celebrate twelve years of peace, I encourage all of us to remain collective and resilient; for we defeated the marauding Ebola virus by our firm spirit of resilience and collectivism. To the entire World that came to our call and stood by us when our country was in perils, I say THANK YOU!!

UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Ban Ki- moon on Wednesday announced the appointment of Farid Zarif of Afghanistan as his special representative for Liberia and head of the UN mission in Liberia (UNMIL). Zarif will succeed Karin Landgren of Sweden, who completed her assignment in July 2015, UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told a daily briefing. Born in 1951, Zarif is currently Ban's special representative to Kosovo and head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). He once served in political, humanitarian and peacekeeping operations in Eritrea, Liberia, South Africa, Iraq and Sudan, said Dujarric. UNMIL was set up in 2003 to bolster a ceasefire agreement after a civil war killed almost 150,000 Liberians -- mostly civilians -- and forced some 850,000 others to flee to neighboring countries.

Younquoi claimed that the project established in the 1960's by government has been abandoned despite of the huge economic value it posits for the survival of the country and its people. According to him, the Kpein Smallholder Rice Project and similar projects in Lofa and Bong Counties, among others, were established by the GOL in its quest to enhance food security in the country with the expropriation of at least 1, 500 acres of land in those areas. He indicated that the Kpein Smallholder Rice Project which had a government-sponsored management team based at the site ceased operation in the late 1990's due to the civil crisis, noting that since the cessation of hostilities in 2003, government has shown no interest in resuscitating the project. Younquoi has therefore begged the indulgence of his colleagues to invite Agriculture Ministry authorities to appear before Plenary to give government's position on the project.

Aug 05, 2015 (The Inquirer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Organizational Profile for Award of the Distinction of ""Commander, Star of Africa"" on the Liberia Council of Churches for its contribution to the fight against Ebola viral disease (EVD)by the Government of Liberia in commemoration of 168th Independence Celebration of the Republic of Liberia.
OVERVIEW OF LCC
The Liberia Council of Churches (LCC) is the country's premier umbrella church organization that was started in 1982 by six national churches to help strengthen the prophetic voice of the church through evangelism, prayer, advocacy, mediation, and humanitarian intervention, amongst others. In three decades, the LCC has become a household name in a deeply religious country where a fratricidal war threatened the very existence of the state. With the Council's unwavering leadership through interfaith and other interventions, Liberia has been able to recover from 25 years of conflict and political stability. At the break of the civil war in 1990, religious leaders drafted the first peace plan that culminated into the ECOWAS Peace Plan and subsequently became the United Nations - backed peace plan to obtain a ceasefire and restore stability to the country.
In July 2003, when all hell broke loose in Liberia again, it was the church leaders under the auspices of the LCC and Liberia for Jesus Prayer Crusade that extensively consulted and engaged former President Taylor at the Executive Mansion to give peace a chance. It was also member churches and organizations of Liberia Council of Churches and other collaborating partners that initially gave birth and support to the Women Mass Action for Peace in Liberia that contributed significantly to the signing of the Accra Comprehensive Peace Agreement in August 2003. Since then, the churches have remained engaged in efforts to consolidate peace and advance reconciliation in the country.
The Liberia Council of Churches works in ecumenical collaboration with other local church groups to enhance church unity and strengthen the prophetic voice of the church in Liberia. The Council is a member of the Fellowship of Christian Councils and Churches in West Africa (FECCIWA), All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), World Council of Churches (WCC) and cooperates with other Christian councils worldwide including the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA. This reputable organization is also a founding member of the Inter-Religious Council of Liberia (IRCL) formerly the Interfaith Mediation Committee (IMC).
The Council operates a Secretariat, headed by a General Secretary, from its headquarters on 15th Street, Sinkor, Monrovia. Every two years, Officers of the council to include a President, First and Second Vice Presidents, and a Treasurer are elected to steer the affairs of the organization.
EBOLA INTERVENTION
When Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) broke out in early March 2014 in the country, the Liberia Council of Churches (LCC) in keeping with the Preamble of the Constitution of Liberia: ""We the People of the Republic of Liberia: Acknowledging our devout gratitude to God for our existence as a Free, Sovereign and Independent State, and relying on His Divine Guidance for our survival as a Nation""; organized two major programs of intercessions to help rally the country and invoke the intervention of our Great Benefactor, the Lord Almighty, to ending the disease outbreak.
The first event marked the commemoration of National Fast and Prayer Day on April 11, 2014. It was preceded by six days of fasting and prayers by members of the Christian community and the public in general and climaxed by a Thanksgiving and Intercessory service at the Providence Baptist Church on Broad Street where the political and religious leaders of the country converged, in heart earnest to beseech God's mercy and forgiveness. For about two months thereafter, Ebola appeared suppressed by the power of prayers.
Subsequently, the disease re-appeared and massively invaded the Capital, Monrovia and most counties of western and North-central Liberia. To help contain this renewed outbreak, the Liberia Council of Churches
 

convened the second meeting of national church leaders at the St. Stephen Episcopal Church in Sinkor on July 30, 2014 with its membership and ecumenical partners, to include the Association of Evangelicals of Liberia, Pentecostal Fellowship Union of Liberia, Liberia Fellowship of Full Gospel Ministers, Apostolic World Christian Fellowship, Prophetic Call to Ministers, Christian Community in Liberia, amongst others, where the Church in Liberia resolved to lead a Three-Day National Stay Home Fast and Prayer Action beginning Wednesday, August 6th thru Friday, August 8th, 2014. At the climax of the 3-day national stay-home fast and prayer action, which the local and international press credited with success, a special intercessory and thanksgiving service was held at the National Shrine of Providence Baptist Church on Broad Street where the Liberia Declaration of Independence was signed on July 26, 1847, to seal the country's prayers and supplications to God. The service was broadcasted live on all local radio stations to bring the rest of the country along in the climax of the fasting and prayers which Liberians wholeheartedly embraced given their faith and reliance on God. It was on August 8, 2014 that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Ebola virus as a Global Public Health International Emergency and called on all nations of the world to join the fight against the disease. This action and appeals led to the floodgate of opportunities that opened up to the country in the fight against the viral disease and introduction of the experimental drug, ZMAPP into the Liberian prescription and or treatment solution In the furtherance of the Divine program for fighting Ebola, the Liberia Council of Churches arranged weekly prayer meetings at the National Shrine of Providence Baptist Church from August 2014 through April 2015. All three branches of Government including the Executive, Legislative and Judiciary; Monrovia City Council, Health workers, Traditional Council; churches, choirs from across the broad spectrum of the Christian community, prayer bands, etc. actively participated in these intercessory services. Night vigils and local and denominational prayer services were also encouraged across the country to ward off Ebola from Liberia. AND GOD DID ANSWER OUR PRAYERS! In addition to its prayer interventions, the Liberia Council of Churches got directly and through its member churches and organizations involved in providing preventive awareness, contact tracing, food and material relief, medical supplies including personal protective gears (PPE's), etc. to affected persons and communities, holding and care centers across the whole nation.Many of LCC member and affiliated partner churches ran health centers that provided immediate medical relief aid to victims of the viral disease thus saving lives while health workers from some of these institutions paid the ultimate price. ""Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friend"". [St. John 15:13]. The LCC, accompanied by committed local and international ecumenical partners.has remained undeterred and focused in the fight against the Ebola viral disease also thrusting inter-faith responses in local communities across the country.","LCC First Vice President Rev.

Monrovia, Jun 16, 2015 (FrontPageAfrica/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Vice President Joseph N. Boakai says the forestry sector of Liberia is no doubt very vital and has been a major contributor to the country's Gross Democratic Product serving as a partner in government development agenda. He said the forest sector contributes to both income generation and employment, stressing the vital nature of the forest to Liberia's overall agenda for transformation.
Vice President Boakai: ""Howbeit, our forest management landscape has been saddled with a host of conflict situations. We have witnessed a litany of situations in which conflicts are fueled in our communities as a result of perception that the sector is not providing benefits as it should to the communities in which they operate. Noteworthy is the unfortunate situation in which this Government was constrained to take steps to investigate the issuance and operations of Private Use Permits.""
The Vice President also said, as the country braces for the reform measures that the Government contemplates, such process should be guided by caution since in fact much of this matter still lies in the court of law. He noted that the Government remains keen on the reform process which is, to some degree, ongoing as evidenced by some modest improvements in its forest governance domain. ""This reform is expected to produce a plethora of benefits. We do intend to streamline our Community Forest Management Agreements so as to ensure that they are in full sync with the Community Rights Law of 2009"", Vice President Boakai furthered.
He continued ""Ours is also the goal of instituting measures that will ensure that Land Rental and Administration fees are disbursed appropriately to duly satisfy community and county entitlements. It is in this regard that we want to assure our communities, particularly areas where timber activities take place, that the Government is doing everything to ensure that their rights and interest are fully protected,"" the Vice President stated.
Speaking at the induction program of officers elect of the Liberia Timber Association (LTA) he called on key movers of the sector of governance system, to be true partners and positive contributors to its efforts. This, he said will help government in constructing a system that will be as equitable and profitable to all concerned. The vice President also reminded officers elect of the LTA that Liberia is signatory to a host of international instruments which place upon its shoulders such great obligation to focus on the sustainable management of Liberia forest assets.
""As signatory to earth-friendly conventions-- and even in line with our own concern for the wellbeing of humanity and the future of our common planet--we have to be a key champion of the efforts to stem negative consequences of mitigating climate change and global warming. Instruments such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol all place upon us such responsibility"", said Vice President Boakai.
The Vice President also declared ""As we urge our citizenry to continue to lend their full support and cooperation to our forestry management guidelines, let me seize this opportune moment to also call on our international partners to step up efforts at emboldening the capacities of our citizens to be comfortably on board with forest protection measures"". Vice President Boakai, a onetime Agriculture Minister of Liberia expressed that he has consistently reminded all that the best way to strengthen the conservation of natural habitat is to bolster the preservation potentials of those who inhabit it.
Executive Order not for correcting issues
Also speaking at the occasion, Mr. Rudolph Merab president elect of the LTA promised that major actors in the forestry sector will manage in a more sustainable way the country forest for the good of Nation and its people. He cautioned government that executive orders should not be the medium used in correcting issues of Law. Merab also raised concern about lack of infrastructure and facilities because according to him
 

infrastructures in places they operate are in deplorable state with the need for more work to be done at the various ports in Liberia. He named the high cost of power or unavailability of power for industrial development such as processing and services as things that add to the cost of production and limits productivity. ""It has been twelve (12) years since the cessation of the hostility and the establishment of this present Government yet the Timber Industry has not reached its full potential in helping to meet neither the need of our development agenda nor the benefits of our people. We had high hopes that by this time around the industry would have evolved and become one of the engines of growth, contributing to nation building by providing jobs, creating downstream investment, education, infrastructure development and become a major contributor to the nation's Income generation"", said Merab. He claimed that the taxes imposed on the sector are higher than most other timber producing countries. Speaking on the legal aspect of the sector he said, the laws are the framework around which they all have to work and the Government, civil society, communities, private sector and international partners will all have to be held to the Law. He said: ""Any action by any party should be according to the Law; the Government and any other institution or Government cannot enter into any agreement outside the guidelines of the Law and expect that agreement to be legal. Merab further said: ""Also the actions we take to remedy any action we presume contrary to the Law needs to follow the rule of Law. When we realize that portions of the law have ambiguity we should not be afraid to seek amendments. We all agree that we are reforming the sector from the way things were; and reform is a process and not an event. Mistake and missteps will take place; we should have the wisdom to mutually work for improvement. An Executive Order cannot and should not be the medium for correcting issues of law.""","Veep Boakai Says Forest Sector Vital for Liberia

13 June 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"13 June 2015 21:31 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Jun 13, 2015 (Africa Renewal/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- A few weeks after she was sworn in as Malawi's first female president, Joyce Banda travelled to Liberia in late April 2012 to meet President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who has occupied Liberia's highest office since January 2006. Glowing in African attire, both leaders bantered like sisters during a press conference.
""This is our day, this is our year, this is our decade,"" enthused Ms.
Banda. ""The two of us have great strength,"" added Ms. Sirleaf.
""Together, we can do more to empower women and to ensure that women's role in society is enhanced.""
After the media event, Duncan Cassell, Liberia's gender minister, said, ""Now we have Joyce [Banda]. Ms. Sirleaf is not going to be lonely among men anymore.""
To be sure, before Ms. Banda became president, photos of African leaders at African Union summits, for example, depicted a group of men surrounding Ms. Sirleaf, who had been the only female president in Africa then.
Gender equality advocates had further reason to celebrate when Catherine Samba-Panza was sworn in on 23 January 2014 as interim president of the Central African Republic (CAR), making her the fourth African female head of state. The first was Ruth Perry, who headed the Liberian transitional government for about a year from September 1996.
Regrettably, Ms. Banda, the second woman to be seated as president, became the first to be unseated when she lost the elections, in what some say was a retaking of power by loyalists of the late President Bingu wa Mutharika.
Rwanda leads the world
""One of the most fascinating developments in African politics has been the increase in women's political participation since the mid-1990s,"" writes Aili Mari Tripp, a professor of gender and women's studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US. Besides the four female heads of state, Ms. Tripp bases her upbeat assessment on the increasing number of women parliamentarians on the continent.
Indeed, with 64% of seats held by women, Rwanda has the highest number of women parliamentarians in the world. Senegal, Seychelles and South Africa have more than 40% each, and Mozambique, Angola, Tanzania and Uganda are not far off, with women occupying over 35% of all parliamentary seats.
Considering that women hold only 19% of the seats in the US congress and 20% in the senate, Ms. Tripp maintains that Africa has every right to be proud. What she did not say is that American women hold top positions in ministries, military and other top government departments, which is not the case in most African countries.
However, a survey on women's participation in politics in 34 African countries by Afrobarometer, a research group that measures public perceptions of socioeconomic and political issues in Africa, notes that while countries such as Rwanda and South Africa may have numerically significant women's parliamentary representation, some of the world's worst performers are also on the continent. For example, women have only 6.2% representation in Swaziland, 6.7% in Nigeria and 8.4% in Benin.
Most Africans demand equality
Nevertheless, the good news is that a vast majority of Africans (72%) agree that women should have the same chance of being elected to political office as men, the Afrobarometer study found. The problem, again,  

is that this majority opinion on gender equality does not exist in some parts of the continent. While 74% of respondents in East Africa believe in women's equality and 73% in Southern Africa, only 50% in North Africa agree that women should have the same rights as men. In fact, women's leadership was rejected by 53% of respondents in Sudan and by 50% in Egypt.
There are many reasons why women's participation in politics is the key to good governance. Experts say women are key to the new breed of politicians who offer Africa the opportunity for democracy. It is interesting that the three female African leaders assumed office during crises or transitions. Ms. Sirleaf was elected after a 13-year devastating civil war; Ms. Banda, who had been vice president, took over after President Bingu wa Mutharika died in office; and Ms. Samba-Panza was sworn in amid rebellion and sectarian violence in the CAR and Ms.
Perry headed the interim government following ceasefire negotiations that ended almost two decades of war.
Not everyone believes women leaders are remarkably different from their male counterparts. Countries in Africa where women are leaders have not always been beacons of good governance, some observers say. But the reasons for this are deep-rooted and beyond the leadership capabilities of such female leaders.
Obstacles to participation
Satang Nabanech, a women's rights advocate and attorney from The Gambia, lists several social, cultural and economic barriers that inhibit women's ability to make significant changes in politics. Ms. Nabanech cites patriarchal politics, or a belief that men must naturally make decisions and that the place for a woman is the home.
In addition, women often lack skills, education and experience to survive in politics, Ms. Nabanech says, stressing that politics is expensive and many women lack the financial assets to succeed in it. ""It is difficult for women to participate in political life when their major concern is survival and they have no choice but to spend much of their time trying to fulfil the basic needs of families.""
Violence in African politics may also discourage participation.
Generally, women feel ""a sense of vulnerability to political intimidation and violence,"" notes the Afrobarometer survey. In Guinea, for instance, 64% of women say they are very concerned about political intimidation.
Worldwide, efforts to enhance women's political participation have shown progress in the past two decades. At the UN Beijing conference on women in 1995, delegates called on governments to have women represent 30% of their governments.
To achieve the Beijing target, some African governments have used different types of quotas to increase women's participation in government. For example, Burkina Faso and Uganda have constitutional provisions reserving a certain number of parliamentary seats for women, Kenya has special seats for women representatives in parliament, while political parties in South Africa and Mozambique have adopted internal rules to ensure a certain percentage of women can vie for office.
Some, however, attack quotas as ineffective. The pros and cons of quotas seem more like a debate over the means to an end. There is less of an argument over the desirability of having more women in politics.
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, chairperson of the African Union, says that although the gap between men and women on political participation remains wide, ""in 46 countries across the world, women account for more than a quarter of all members of parliament. I am also proud to say that 14 of these countries are in Africa"". When it comes to women's political participation, Africa could well be on the right track.","A Celebratory Rise in Women's Political Participation [analysis]

28 May 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"28 May 2015 18:41 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved May 28, 2015 (The Daily Observer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Turning 50 is a day that certainly signifies a lot of meaning for the person's life. Just like any other birthday anniversary though, it is a time for looking back to 50 wondrous years of life and a time for looking forward to even more surprises that the future has in store.
If there is someone close to you that is about to turn 50, you have most likely realised how the occasion isn't at all ordinary. Such is the case for His Excellency Sheikh Professor Alhaji Dr Yahya AJJ Jammeh.
For the purpose of this article, we want to focus more on how The Gambia has been transformed in the last twenty years of the APRC government under the leadership of President Jammeh who turned 50 on May 25 this year, at a time also when the country is celebrating its golden jubilee and as well the 20 years of the progressive development of the mighty July 22nd Revolution.
As early as the transition period in 1994, the AFPRC/APRC government in its rectification programme under the chairmanship of President Jammeh established institutions to uphold the ethics of good governance and democratisation process.
Since then work began in earnest, embarking on projects such as construction of roads, schools, the establishment of the first university programme, and health facilities, among others.
Medical School
The great foresight among many other targets set by the APRC government since 1994 has been the establishment of the medical school, which is now graduating so many homegrown doctors.
Medical equipment
To enhance medical services and operations, President Jammeh saw the need to acquire state-of-the-earth medical equipment, significant among them: CT scanner, Endoscopic machine, Hemodialysis machine, Oxygen concentrator, and Laparoscopic machine. This equipment has improved diagnosis and they have also saved many Gambians the cost of going abroad for treatment or diagnosis.
The APRC crusade in the health sector has resulted in: cheaper access to government medical services which has been just five-dalasi for almost twenty years per person, until late 2014 when it was increased to twenty five d alasi only, and the reductions in maternal and child mortality, as well as improved life expectancy (44-57years)
The Agriculture sector
The agriculture sector has received no less attention by government since inception. With the back-to-the-land call by the Gambian leader himself, tremendous awareness rising has been registered about the significance of self-reliance.
While achievements are no doubt being registered in terms of the projects being initiated by government, the personal intervention of President Jammeh has impacted greatly on the sector, with regards to participation of the people. And also, over the years, government has provided hundreds of tractors to farmers, with a number of incentives. A number of new crop varieties aimed at improving the productive base of the farming community in The Gambia have also impacted greatly on the sector. But the most brilliant among the entire anti-hunger crusade was the sanctioning of the Vision 2016 initiative, which aims to put hunger at bay and make Gambia a food self-sufficient nation by 2016.
 

There are all hopes and indication that this is achievable because the leadership commitment is there, already a year into the target, the president has put under cultivation over 3000 hectares of land in just the Central River Region.
Women & youth empowerment
The APRC government was quick to realise the potentials of women and the key role they could play in national development. Women, therefore, enjoy equal opportunities since the advent of the Revolution. The Gambia can boast of key positions manned by women. Example, the vice presidency, the Office of the Secretary General was before manned by a female, Office of the Speaker of the National Assembly has also been manned by women speakers for many years, coupled with many other ministerial positions, directors, permanent secretaries, village heads, national assembly members, and of late the appointment of the first female governor of the West Coast region, the list goes on.
The empowerment is felt across the board as women at all levels, including grassroots, participate in national affairs.
Energy sector
Before the birth of the July 22nd Revolution, Gambia's utility institution was only able to provide electricity to most of its customers for only 12hrs or sometimes none at all, for days, due to low generating capacity. Even there, electricity supply was within a limited area. Today, energy is supplied throughout the country. This is made possible because of the increase in the number of generators, resulting in the construction of a new power plant in Brikama, under the watchful eyes of President Jammeh. That has resulted in the expansion of coverage to major coastal settlements such as Brufut, Sukuta, Sanyang, Tanji, Tujereng and Jambanjelly, and as well as the West Coast electrification project amongst others.
The rural electrification project has enabled 46 towns and villages in rural Gambia to benefit from electricity supply, with new power stations installed in Barra-Essau, Kerewan, Farafenni, Kaur, Bansang and Basse. Today, most rural villages, which were deserted due to the menace of rural-urban drift, are turning into financial centres due to the intensity of economic activities. This is as a result of accessibility to electricity supply.
Investment climate
The advent of July 22 Revolution has seen remarkable achievements in the country's economic sector too. Seen as a country traditionally dependent on agriculture, The Gambia has over the past 2 decades been making promising strides towards industrialisation. And with the provision of the conducive environment, the private sector has been given the chance to explore all the available investment opportunities.
Sectors like tourism, trade and fisheries have seen significant improvement. The banking and financial sector is flourishing as attestable by the continuous inflow of financial institutions. It is good to note also that the performance of The Gambia's economy has been so worthwhile that it has been mentioned in a number of reports by reputable international institutions like the IMF.
Telecommunication
The country's booming telecommunication sector has also added impetus to the growing financial sector. This is also attributable to the sound ICT policies of government.
The telecommunication sector has seen the birth of four GSM service providers in the country - Gamcel, Africell, Comium and Qcell. This has been hailed as the beginning of the revolutionization of not only the GSM industry, but also the business and other sectors the technology is relevant to.
Road infrastructure
From the beginning of the Revolution, it had become a focus for government that existing roads are not only rehabilitated, but that new roads are also constructed to facilitate the much needed communication for continued development. A number of projects have been embarked upon by government in this regard. They include the 168km Kombo Coastal road; the rehabilitation and upgrading of the 20km Barra-Amdallai road, 13km Mandinaba-Seleti road, 193km Soma-Basse road, 23km Basse-Wellingara road, as well as the trans-Gambia Highway. Already the West Field-Mandinaba road has been fixed. The newly constructed Brikama-Dimbaya-Darsilami roads, has also been completed and commissioned as part of activities marking the 20th anniversary celebrations of the great July 22nd Revolution. These are just some of the major achievements registered by the APRC government under the leadership of His Excellency Sheikh Professor Alhaji Dr Yahya Jammeh.
Gambia's participation in peace-keeping missions since 1994
 

It's no secret that since 1994, The Gambia, through The Gambia Armed Forces has been participating in a range of peacekeeping operations; from the woodland of Burma, the mountainous regions of Nepal, the forest region of Congo, Burundi to Angola, the sand storms of Darfur, Chad; the rainy region of Liberia, Ivory Coast, Guinea Bissau, and Sierra Leone and to the mercurial region of Eritrea and Ethiopia. This has in one way or the other improved the lives of the personnel of The Gambia armed and security services, financially, and morally.
Gambian troops have been sent to East Timor and Kosovo; they formed part of the UN peace-keeping forces. In all these conflict areas, Gambians have in the image of their youthful, committed and peace-loving President, performed with distinction and honour.
The Gambia also participated in a 12-month peacekeeping mission in the Sudanese region of Darfur, the first to serve for that duration since that country began the United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) in the year 2004.
Since The Gambia became independent in 1965 and joined the United Nations in that same year, it only became a member of the Security Council for the first time in 1999 under President Jammeh's regime.
The Security Council being the organ of the United Nations charged with the responsibility for the maintenance of international peace, Gambian membership to this august body is an eloquent expression of the recognition of The Gambia's exemplary record of peace, democracy and stability under the leadership of President Jammeh.
Settlement of disputes and conflicts
Cognizance of the importance he attached to peace, security and stability, the Gambian leader did not only advocate this, but has physically demonstrated it by playing a greater role in settling disputes between political opponents in countries such as Guinea Bissau when he gathered all of its stakeholders and political opponents in Banjul to an open dialogue as means to unite politicians in that former Portuguese colony.
That political forum was described by many as historic; that has provided the Gambian leader the opportunity to interact with major political party leaders of The Gambia such as Lawyer Ousainou Darboe, Hamat Bah and Lamin Waa Juwara, the party leaders of the UDP, NRP and NDAM respectively.
The presence of the Gambian opposition leaders in that forum clearly demonstrates President Jammeh's commitment to unity and the promotion of peace and stability in the sub-region and Gambia in particular.
President Jammeh, in October 1998, succeeded in bringing to the negotiating table President Joa Bernardo Vieira and General Ansumane Mane for their first face-to-face meeting in Banjul since the two were locked in a fratricidal struggle for power in Guinea Bissau. From the Banjul meeting, President Jammeh flew with the two men to attend the 21st ECOWAS Summit in Abuja where the two men signed the Abuja Accord, which called for the establishment of a government of National Unity, the withdrawal of foreign troops and the deployment of ECOMOG, the military intervention unit for ECOWAS.
Hosting of AU summit
For the first time in the history of the country, The Gambia hosted the 7th edition of the African Union summit in Banjul on 1st and 2nd July 2006, the largest diplomatic gathering in Banjul, which Jammeh's government funded 98 percent.
Before the start of the summit in Banjul, the private sector also contributed towards its successful hosting. It was a golden opportunity for the private sector to showcase their business products and services to the wider international and local participants and delegates to the event.
Gambia's participation at the international level
As a man of peace, President Yahya Jammeh continues to play a major role in peace making and peace keeping in West Africa, other parts of the Continent and in the World at large. His expressed commitment to the principle that ""development on the Continent will never be possible without lasting peace and stability"" is exemplified by the indefatigable efforts he deploys and his success achieved to this end.
In the West African sub-region, President Jammeh initiated the ECOWAS Mechanism for Conflict Resolution, which was formulated and designed in Banjul, which became designated as one of the peace observatories in the sub region.
The historic Guinea-Bissau handshake brokered by President Jammeh
President Jammeh, in October 1998, succeeded in bringing to the negotiating table President Joao Bernardo Vieira and General Ansumane Mane for their first face to face meeting in Banjul since the two were locked in  

a fratricidal struggle for power in Guinea Bissau. From Banjul, President Jammeh flew with the two men to attend the ongoing 21st ECOWAS Summit. In Abuja, the two men signed the Abuja Accord which called for the establishment of a Government of National Unity, the withdrawal of foreign troops and the deployment of ECOMOG, the military intervention unit for ECOWAS.
Significantly President Jammeh made sure that President Nino and General Mane travelled with him in the same special flight to the Abuja Meeting, and stayed an extra day to oversee the signature of the Agreement.
Although the Peace Accord was short-lived, President Jammeh continued in his efforts to avert the escalation of the conflict in Guinea Bissau. Accordingly when the deposed President Vieira was reported to be in poor health and under house arrest, the Gambian Leader intervened on humanitarian grounds for the Bissau authorities at the time to allow the ex-president to travel out of the country. The Gambia then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Dr. Lamin Sedat Jobe was sent to Bissau to accompany Vieira to Banjul in a special flight for medical treatment in The Gambia prior to proceeding to Portugal for asylum.
The Gambia was one of the first to send in February 1999 a Contingent to make up the 600 ECOMOG troops charged with the responsibility of enforcing the cease-fire agreed by the ECOWAS Heads of States.
President Jammeh's peace initiatives and objective demarches contributed immensely to the restoration of democracy in Guinea Bissau through multi party general elections under the supervision of the United Nations and the assistance of friendly countries including The Gambia.
The mediation efforts of President Jammeh in the quest for a peaceful settlement of the conflict between the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC) and the Government of Senegal brought new hope for peace to be enjoyed again by the population of the Southern Region of Senegal after nearly two decades of war and the loss of more than 1200 lives. Again Banjul was the platform in June 1999, for peace negotiations, which President Jammeh facilitated and which was welcome and hailed by the two parties in conflict. Much progress was made and for the first time there was general optimism that peace and stability would return to Casamance.
Against this backdrop the then Senegalese President Abdou Diouf and MFDC leaders agreed that The Gambia should continue to host subsequent meetings and negotiations until the conclusion of a lasting peace. The new Senegalese Head of State, President Abdoulaye Wade at that time has equally recognised the need for Gambian mediation in the conflict. On his part, President Jammeh has expressed his willingness to join forces with others committed to the search for the rapid and lasting solution to the internecine conflict in Casamance.
President Jammeh was concerned about the conflict involving Sierra Leone, Liberia and The Republic of Guinea, which is destroying the very foundation on which the Mano River Union was built with great expectations for their people, for sub regional integration and for African Unity. At the very early stage of the crisis The Gambian President played a very important role in bringing about direct talks in Abuja between the warring factions of Liberia. Spending 16 hours in non-stop dialogue with the Liberian warlords, the Gambian leader personally undertook the herculean task of convincing the Liberian warlords of the need to have direct dialogue. This marathon mediation effort led to the Liberian warlords embracing each other as brothers for the very first time since the Liberian civil war broke out. Battle hardened Liberian Generals broke down in tears on that day.
In 1999, the US Embassy compound was under siege by the Taylor regime and it was thanks to the mediation of President Jammeh that President Taylor allowed the Americans to evacuate Roosevelt Johnson and his militants from the US Embassy compound to Sierra Leone.
Early in the Sierra Leone conflict President Jammeh was the first leader to offer to mediate between the Sierra Leone Government and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) led by Foday Sankoh. In the same vein the Gambian leader has played host to the respective leaders of the countries of the Mano River Union (Sierra Leone, Liberia and Republic of Guinea) on a number of occasions, and has visited all three countries.
In pursuit of his historic mission for peace for all especially in neighbouring countries and the ECOWAS sub-region President Jammeh, made a two- day visit to Sierra-Leone to give hope to and as a mark of solidarity with the Government and people of Sierra Leone who yearn so much for peace and stability. President Jammeh, who was visibly moved by the sight of the Sierra Leonean amputees, assured the people of Sierra Leone that he would forever be on a mission to ensure that such atrocities never occurred again in this world.
In April 2001, President Charles Taylor paid a one-day visit to The Gambia at the end of which President Jammeh succeeded in eliciting from President Taylor a commitment to resolve the erstwhile problem between him and President Kabbah of Sierra Leone and President Conte of Guinea regarding the expulsion of the Ambassadors of Sierra Leone and Liberia in a fraternal manner.
 

The President's efforts to restore regional peace has also been characterized by a humanitarian dimension as attested by the various refugee camps in The Gambia which have become safe havens for refugees fleeing violence and the ravages of war especially from Sierra Leone and Casamance and at one time Guinea Bissau. As part of its effort to improve conditions in camps, especially at the Kerr Alhassan Camp, A programme of food-for-work has been instituted among other positive community schemes. As a champion of African Unity, following the footsteps of the great pan Africanist the late Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, President Jammeh deployed every effort to solve the protracted Libyan-Western impasse following the Pan Am bombing. Thus the Gambian Leader who had sponsored during the Annual Meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Countries in 1997 the famous motion denouncing violence as a weapon of solving problems by the Islamic world, initiated the process to see to it that the whole truth about the alleged Pan Am bombing was brought out in the open to bring relief to the families of the victims as well as Libyan people who had for long suffered under the sanctions imposed because of the bombing allegations. The road to Vision 2020 The concept behind the goals of the Vision 2020 blueprint is to transform The Gambia into a paradise of some sort. Given the achievement realised within this short period of time, compared to what we had achieved as a nation from pre-independence to the end of the First Republic, there is every reason to rejoice the eminence of reaching the end on the onward journey to the Vision 2020. It must, however, be reiterated that reaching this end is assured only with the concerted effort of every single Gambian. Unarguably, the new order of the 21st Century development trajectory has been massive investments in public infrastructure, running into millions and billions of Dollars. The era has seen visionary governments around the world assigning huge chunks of their budgets to public infrastructure, premised on the fact that no sustainable development can take place without this in-dispensable necessity. But even at the level of regional groupings, enhanced infrastructure is a key item on the agenda. Such is the case at both the levels of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the African Union - each has unit for infrastructural development and The Gambia under the Second Republic has an ambitious government under the watch of His Excellency Sheikh Prof. Alh. Dr. Yahya Jammeh. In this race to rapid modernization through enhanced infrastructure, his 20-year-old government is not trailing behind. Since the birth of a new Gambia in 1994, one of the hallmarks of the Revolution has been capital investment in public infrastructure across the board. It is best anchored on the glaring fact that infrastructural development is an indispensable investment need that any serious and responsible government would prioritize as far as meeting the targets is concerned. Taking into account all these development achieved within the last twenty years under the leadership of His Excellency Sheikh Professor Alhaji Dr Yahya Jammeh one would always agree that the Gambian has all reasons to celebrate 20 years of success and 50 years of his life. What makes it more important and so special is the fact that it is being celebrated at the time when the Gambia is celebrating its 50th year anniversary of nationhood. The president's birthday is also being celebrated on a day highly recognised and observed as a red letter day in the history of the African continent, May 25th, Africa Liberation Day is the day when His Excellency was also born.","Gambia Today As Jammeh Celebrates 50 [column]

May 28, 2015 (The Guardian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- WEST African griots are fabled story-tellers and troubadours who preserve the history of their people for successive generations. The tale that we tell here is of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) which turns 40 today (28 May), though still struggling to increase trade among its 15 members. West Africa is a sub-region rich in oil, gas, gold, iron ore, uranium, cocoa, cotton, and cashew nuts, but has some of the poorest populations in the world. This is despite the fact that there are many cultural links across borders which should facilitate regional integration: Yorubas inhabit Nigeria and Benin; Hausas, Nigeria and Niger; Ewes, Ghana and Togo; Mandingos, Liberia and Guinea; while Balantas are spread across Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, and Gambia.
Nigerian scholar-technocrat, Adebayo Adedeji, is widely regarded as the ""Father of ECOWAS"". He had outlined a vision for regional integration in West Africa in a journal article in 1970, before turning theory into practice. As Nigeria's Minister of Economic Development under the administration of General Yakubu Gowon, Adedeji convinced 15 West African leaders to establish ECOWAS by 1975, following three years of tireless ""shuttle diplomacy"" - with the Togolese government - across the sub-region.
ECOWAS has recorded four key achievements. First, the organisation has successfully established a protocol as early as 1979 that allows the free movement of its 340 million citizens across the sub-region. The legendary women traders of West Africa have taken advantage and acted as motors of regional integration, while 68% of West Africa's international migrants remain in the sub-region, enjoying one of the world's most impressive mobility rates. Second, ECOWAS - under the leadership of Guinea's Lansana Kouyate established the continent's first sub-regional security mechanism in 1999. The mechanism built on the lessons of the Nigeria-led ECOWASCeasefire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) peacekeeping interventions in Liberia and Sierra Leone in the 1990s in which over 2,500 West African peacekeepers died so that both countries could live. Sub-regional peacekeepers have subsequently been deployed to Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau.
ECOWAS' third main achievement was to create a governance protocol - under the leadership of Ghana's Mohammed Chambas - in 2001, which helped with some of the difficult democratisation challenges in Guinea, Niger, and Togo. Contrary to the autocratic days of sub-regional ""big men"" who sought to cling to power with iron fists, after the end of the Cold War, alternance - the change of regime from one ruling party to another - has occurred in Benin, Ghana, Senegal, and most recently, in Nigeria. The organisation has also played an important role in Burkina Faso's current democratic transition following the toppling of the 27-year old autocracy of Blaise Compaore last October. The fourth important achievement of ECOWAS is the creation of an innovative community levy in 2000 to help fund the organisation. Although the levy is irregularly paid, other African regional bodies could learn lessons from this scheme to reduce their dependence on the vagaries of external funding.
Despite this progress, ECOWAS has also suffered four key failures. Between 1960 and 1990, West Africa was Africa's most coup-prone sub-region, accounting for 37 of the 72 successful putsches. This culture of militarism remains rife in Mali, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, Gambia, and Togo. Even in Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, a former military autocrat, will assume office tomorrow (29 May). The increasing violence of insurgent groups such as Nigeria's Boko Haram, Mali's Ansar Dine and the Mouvement pour l'unicite et le jihad en Afrique de l'Ouest (MUJAO) as well as Algeria's Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has expanded ECOWAS' security complex beyond West Africa to Central and North Africa, threatening regime security in Nigeria, Niger, and Mali, as well as Chad and Cameroon.
ECOWAS' second failure involves the penchant of its leaders to engage in bouts of political alchemy and their inability to build durable sub-regional institutions. West African leaders have dreamed up schemes such as trans-regional highways, railways, factories, a power pool, a gas pipe-line, and a monetary union, most of which have failed to materialise. Intra-regional trade remains an anaemic nine per cent after four decades, as industrialisation has stalled and an economic union appears a long way off. Most countries also have too
 

small markets, with only Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, and Ghana having populations over 20 million. Even as domestic parliaments and courts struggle to consolidate their legitimacy, a sub-regional parliament and Court of Justice have been established in a fit of ""euphoric planning."" Despite progress in the free movement of persons, smuggling remains rampant while extortion of sub-regional travellers by customs officials remains rife. ECOWAS' West African Health Organisation (WAHO) seemed helpless in tackling last year's Ebola epidemic which ravaged Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, killing 11,120 people in the three countries. The third failure of ECOWAS is the continuing ubiquitous and negative presence of French neo-colonialism in West Africa. Paris had sought to break up Nigeria during its civil war in 1967-1970 in order to reduce the country's potential influence on the sub-region's eight francophone countries. It also encouraged francophone countries to form rival trade blocs that contradicted ECOWAS' integration goals. Today, the currency of these countries is still tied to a French-backed euro, while Paris maintains a 3000-strong military presence in Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, and Senegal; as well as an air force and drones in Niger. French companies also continue to dominate many of the strategic sectors in these countries, though there is a growing Chinese presence in the sub-region. It is often said that whenever Nigeria sneezes, West Africa catches a cold. The final failure of ECOWAS has been the lack of vision and leadership by the sub-region's potential hegemon: Nigeria. The country - which hosts the ECOWAS secretariat in Abuja - accounts for about 80% of West Africa's economy, half of its population, and 16 of its 20 largest banks. Nigeria also sells $350 million worth of goods to its ECOWAS neighbours. Any successful regional integration in the sub-region must thus necessarily be built on a solid Nigerian foundation. West Africa's Gulliver has, however, suffered from visionless leadership, debilitating corruption, infrastructural decay, widespread poverty, and a failure to achieve an industrial take-off, negatively affecting ECOWAS' progress. As Adebayo Adedeji scathingly put it: ""No country that is confronted with a long period of political instability, economic stagnation, and regression, and is reputed to be one of the most corrupt societies in the world, has a moral basis to lead others. If it tries to, it will be resisted."" Looking ahead, Nigeria is clearly a more natural hegemon in West Africa than France. Paris is a hyperactive power whose delusions of grandeur and pretensions to global power are being embarrassingly exposed. The Gallic power continues to suffer a serious financial crisis that has damaged its leadership credibility in Europe, and will surely eventually force it to reduce its presence in West Africa. For ECOWAS to achieve its integration goals in the next four decades, it will, however, be important that Nigeria provides the able political, economic, and military leadership that can fulfil ECOWAS' region-building aspirations. This griot's tale can still have a happy ending. Dr. Adebajo is Executive Director of the Centre for Conflict Resolution, Cape Town, South Africa.","Ecowas At 40 - A Griot's Tale [analysis]

May 18, 2015 (Daily Trust/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Retired Major-General Mohammed Dan'Hanne Isah was the Commandant of the Infantry Centre and School (ICS) in Jaji in 2012 when the military institution was attacked by suspected insurgents. The incident, which led to the death of many people, including senior military officers, culminated in the disengagement of the General, under controversial circumstances, from the military. The retired army officer, in this interview with Sunday Trust, spoke about the poor handling of the security situation in Jaji which made the attacks possible and the window that gunmen exploited and killed Sheikh Jafar Mahmud Adam.
He also identified lapses in the military command as reasons behind cases of soldiers fleeing battlefield, in addition to other intelligence failures that gave Boko Haram the room to grow and pose a big threat. The General also narrated how Governor Sa'idu Dankingari lured him into politics, with a promise to support him as PDP's governorship candidate in the state, and more.
How do you feel whenever you hear that Nigerian Army soldiers have fled the battlefield?
I feel sad. But to be honest, Nigerian soldiers are among the best in the world. I commanded soldiers in operation for over three years and I know what they can do. So when I heard that (they were fleeing from battle), I believed something was wrong with the command, but certainly not with the soldiers. If you command soldiers in operation, there are things that you will discover.
I once went through hell when I was commanding troops to an operation in Bakassi. The headquarters was getting enough supply of fuel, but at the units (the battalions under it), there was nothing to write home about. I remember in my own case, the Brigade Commander used to give more (fuel) than he was giving the other battalions. But even at that, what I was given was nothing to write home about. I had about 22 outposts, all of them isolated in the riverine area and I was never given more than half a tank of fuel in a month for four vehicles. How would I share it? It was not enough for me alone. It got to a point where I had to write that, 'I don't have fuel and in case of any attack, I will certainly repel it but I will not pursue (the attackers).' So such things do happen.
I remember when I captured Boro Camp, my GOC visited me and he said even his division did not have what he saw there. Could you believe that it was the gunboats that I captured from them (the Cameroonian Army) that I was using to attack them?
Were they better equipped than the Nigerian Army?
No. The assets they had were better than mine, because I was not given. If you don't command troops to operation, you will not know their requirements and their needs. But in my own case, my soldiers had trust in me, and if you are honest with soldiers under you, they will work wonders.
So when I heard what happened I felt bad and said, 'this is not the Nigerian Army that I used to know.' Certainly, something was wrong somewhere.
If, as a Lieutenant-Colonel, your battalion was not given adequate fuel, does that mean the decay in the military is not a new phenomenon?
When you complain in the army, they say: ""wait for your time."" But some of us, then, did not accept to wait for our time. All my former commanders knew me as someone who insisted that the right thing must be done and if it was not done, I put it in writing for posterity. Whenever I did not have fuel, I wrote them that I will defend my area, but I will not pursue and I will not be defeated. I know that throughout my stay, I was never defeated. It was not that I was very strong at the time, but what I was doing was shifting force. Whenever there was an attack, I shifted all my assets there and hit, so they (the Cameroonians) believed that my unit was very strong, for that they were scared of me.
 

So, after coming under an attack one day, I wrote again that I have repelled an attack, but I was not able to pursue because I didn't have fuel. They (the Brigade Headquarters) forwarded my memo to the Division, and some people started saying, ""Isah would be in for it."" When it got to the Division, the GOC happened to be General Sangotade and he was someone who knew me. So he said, ""No, that is not the Isah I know; Isah is not a coward. Something must be wrong somewhere. He sent Col Ajayi, his Colonel GS (General Staff) to go and investigate. When he interviewed me, I gave him the copies of all the signals I had sent to the Brigade and he was surprised. When he got back to the Division and told the GOC of his findings, the GOC said: ""I told you Isah is not a coward. Something must be wrong somewhere."" I don't know what transpired between the GOC and the Brigade Commander, but I know I was exonerated and from then on, I always got whatever I requested for.
What came to your mind when Nigerian soldiers ran and took refuge in Cameroon?
I felt devastated. Even if you are not given troops to command, as long as you are a soldier or an officer, serving or retired, once you hear of that episode, sincerely speaking you will be devastated. Ask most of our senior officers who left the army about 30 years ago, they will tell you that is not the army they knew, because they left strong legacies for us who came behind. Nigerian Army used to be one of the best in the world; its troops were highly disciplined, professional and committed to their jobs.
Why did Boko Haram become a difficult challenge for the army to deal with?
If you remember some years back, one notorious armed robber called Anini in Bendel, now Edo State, said that if there is no information, there will not be stealing. You have to have information about your target before you can hit it. Soldiers don't operate blindly. I remember sometime in 2004, Boko Haram were uprooted around Kanem in Yobe State and somewhere around Gwoza hill, by the 21 Armoured Brigade or so. That time they were called Taliban. Some of us asked: ""Why do they call them Taliban?"" We knew Taliban are found somewhere in Pakistan or Afghanistan. In Pakistan, they
are based in North Waziristan, which is a tribal area in the country. When they called themselves Taliban, our security system should have studied how the Taliban operates in those areas. The Boko Haram operates just like the Taliban. Don't forget that in 2002, they were said to have received $3m from Al-Qa'ida. What have our security agencies done about it? Three million dollars is not a joke. The Taliban attacked Serena Hotel in Kabul, our own Boko Haram attacked the UN building here in Abuja. They attacked the American base in Kabul, our own Boko Haram attacked Maimalari and Bama Barracks in Borno. Before all the attacks, they had been recruiting and training. Our security should have discovered that, and when they were chased out of Maiduguri, they moved into Sambisa Forest. While in the forest, our security agencies should have discovered the camps. There are so many ways to do that. For instance, wherever insurgents have a camp, they use vehicles for supplies and leave tracks in the process. This, in addition to disturbed vegetation, can be looked out for by a foot patrol. Similarly, with the advancement in information technology, our security agencies should have discovered all these things and provided the information to the military to go and hit them.
Why do you think they have failed to do that?
Honestly, I don't know. What I know is that it is the responsibility of our security agencies and that is why the security system needs to be reorganized and reequipped. They should bridge the gap that exists between the agencies. The armed forces also need to be reorganized and repositioned to meet the challenges of 21st century security threats. They should know that they complement, not compete with each other.
One other matter that has placed the operational capacity of the military under the searchlight is the Chibok girls' abduction. Could it be that we are unable to rescue the girls because our military is not experienced in rescue operations of this nature?
The army is doing its best in this situation. But before you can rescue somebody you have to know where they are.
The Chief of Defence Staff once disclosed that they knew where the girls were. Did they truly?
Well, I think he should answer that question. I will not speak for him.
How experienced is the Nigerian Army in handling such situations?
We have the experience. You can only rescue somebody when you know where he is. If you don't know where he is, how can you rescue him? The Boko Haram at times behave like the Lord Resistance Army (LRA) of Joseph Kony. The Lord Resistance Army claim to be a Christian fundamentalist organization, but they don't have regards for the 10 Commandments in the Bible. They kill indiscriminately, they abduct women and girls, use them as sex-slaves and they kidnap. If Boko Haram wants to establish an Islamic state as they claim, why do they kill? No religion allows killing, but they kill, they kidnap women and use them as
 

sex-slaves. Just yesterday, I heard a woman crying when she was being interviewed by an international radio; she was crying over how her daughter was abused. Most of the girls that were rescued came back pregnant. Does the Islamic religion allow that? These people act like a bunch of thugs.
People like the late Sheikh Jafar Adam had attempted to expose the violent ideology of the sect before he was killed. Why didn't the security agencies use the information he provided?
Sheikh Jafar happened to be close to me when I was the Brigade Commander in Kano. Because Kano is very volatile, I adopted a system of visiting Imams every Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays to plead with them to preach peace. Because what I discovered in Kano is that the people there are very peaceful. But whatever happens in Kano is the spillover from another place and it always occurs on Friday after Juma'at prayers. So, I now met the Imams and enjoined them to preach peace every Friday. Throughout my period as a commander, there was no disturbance and even when there were some crises elsewhere, I liaised with other security agencies and the police commissioner to stop any dead body from being brought into Kano, because once it comes in there would be problem.
So Jafar happened to be one of the people I visited and he was also coming to my office. He claimed that they (Boko Haram) had threatened to kill him and I advised him to meet the director of SSS and the police commissioner, who was MD Abubakar, to get protection, because I could not give him protection. But I assured him that I would visit him four times a week, and that whenever I was going to come, I would come with my convoy, as deterrence. That was whether he was in or not.
He reported the threat to the police commissioner and MD Abubakar did an excellent job. But somewhere along the line, MD Abubakar and I were transferred from Kano. I was transferred to the Defence College as a directing staff and MD Abubakar was transferred to Lagos as Airport commissioner. It was after we left that he was killed. What happened then was a system failure.
The military is being consistently criticized for involving in politics, with the case of Buhari's certificate scandal often cited as an example. Why do you think the military is lending itself to being a political tool for fighting partisan conflicts?
The case of Buhari's certificate is an insult to all the Generals in the Nigerian Army, both serving and retired. If they think their action was a political blackmail against Buhari, they were not doing it against Buhari.. They were doing it against the army. General Buhari was a GOC, he was a Military Secretary (MS), and in fact he signed my dispatch of commission into the Nigerian Army. He was the person who signed as a Military Secretary when I was commissioned as an officer. So whatever you said about the military, he was an authority, and above all, he was a Commander-in-Chief.
I'm happy General Akinrinade has replied them. That incident is one reason that the Nigerian Army needs to be reorganized to flush out the political officers or soldiers. I served in the Military Secretary's office as a Major under the former Head of State, General Abdusalami Abubakar. Later I went back as an MS, as a Major General. For someone now to say, general Buhari has no certificate, it means that all the officers who served in the Nigerian Army don't have certificates. That is what it implies. At the time that General Buhari joined the army, the process was strict, because it was during the colonial era, under the British. The British were very strict, unlike now. You don't join the army with notes during their time. Now it is something else.
I remember when I went to serve as the secretary of the selection board; I think the boys we screened are now colonels. You need to see the notes that they brought; some of them were from heavy names. The president of the board then, Admiral Sa'idu, kept sending the notes to me, saying: ""Isah treat."" Then later, he said, ""Look Isah, we want to do the selection purely on merit"" and asked, ""What of the notes?"" By then, we had finished everything. By the time I brought out the notes, all those big names that sent them had none of their candidates selected. He said, ""Yes. If they didn't pass, they didn't pass."". So, for somebody to wake up and say General Buhari has no certificate is an insult and somebody must pay for it.
Do you mean somebody has to be punished for it?
All I'm saying is somebody must pay for it.
But what must have given rise to the military's position?
It is all political blackmail and mischief. That is why I said the military needs to be reorganized to flush out those politicians. We need to have professionals, who will work in accordance with the ethics of the job.
What is your take on the ceasefire that was unilaterally declared by the military last year?
Let me also ask, is a ceasefire one-sided? Even in negotiations, it is done on the basis of win-win, not win-lose. If it is a win-lose, by the time the other party understands that it has lost a lot, it will throw everything
 

overboard. So what you have was a one-sided ceasefire. I didn't hear the Boko Haram talking about a ceasefire.
With all the cases of insecurity, ranging from Boko Haram, militancy and kidnappings ravaging various parts of the country, what should the incoming administration do to address them?
Tackling Boko Haram and other security challenges is a complex thing. It is something that requires a lot of strategies. First, you need international cooperation, political will, military effort, legal angle and the media.
Then you have to go back to the factors that gave rise to the challenges. The federal and state governments have to tackle unemployment in partnership with the private sector by providing jobs. Once somebody is gainfully employed with finally security, they would not be thinking of taking up arms.
Then, the security services need to be reorganized. There should be regular verification exercises at military formations to ensure that government's arms are not stolen.
When I was a Brigade Commander in Kano, one of my battalion commanders sent his arms return and we discovered some discrepancies between what he sent that month and the previous one. So we asked him to verify, but he only dusted up the previous report and sent it back the same day. I went and met the GOC and requested for an independent arms verification to be carried out in my own Brigade. The GOC said no need, but I insisted that I wanted it. After about a week, I wrote to the GOC and when there was still no response after two weeks, I sent a reminder again. Later, I met him and said, ""Sir, I will foot the bill, just constitute the board."" I did that because I didn't want to constitute it myself, because it would be as if I was checking myself. I wanted the Division to come and check and verify the arms holding in my Brigade, comprising Katsina, Nguru and Janguza battalions.
They eventually came and I accommodated them. It was because of that verification that the military knew that over a hundred weapons were unaccounted for. What happened was that one of the units was in Liberia and when they were returning to Nigeria, they were asked to leave their weapons in Liberia. When the unit's arms file was checked, they found an authority ordering the CO (Commanding Officer) to leave the weapons there. However, instead of the CO to strike the weapons off the unit's strength when he came back, he didn't do that, but continued to give returns as if they were still there.
Also, it was that verification exercise that led to the discovery of the missing arms in Kaduna. That was how the weapons were discovered to have been taken to the Niger Delta. If not that I had insisted, nobody would have known the true state of the arms. It was after I requested for arms verification that the GOC ordered other Brigades and units to carry out the same. That is why I said there should be regular arms verifications across military units, to make sure that government's weapons are not stolen.
I also remember when I was a GOC in Enugu, there was a syndicate that was stealing police weapons and selling them to armed robbers. It happened in Ebonyi State. When I arrested the policeman involved, we transferred the case to Hafiz Ringim, who was the Assistant Inspector- General of Police in Umuahia. So, with regular verification exercises, government weapons would not be stolen.
Another thing is, government arm suppliers should be accredited and vetted. Government should also look into the activities of local arms manufacturers to check the circulation of illegal arms. Equally, all the non-state actors, like the militants, must be disarmed.
When we talk of insurgency, there are two components: the overt and the covert. The overt are the foot soldiers who are operating daily, but the covert are the sympathizers, supporters and financiers. The government should unmask them, as a way to curtail the situation. And then their source of weapons and income must be cut.
Remember, the Boko Haram wrote a letter to ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria), pledging allegiance to them and ISIS accepted them. So, if going to Iraq, for example, is too far, people can come to Nigeria to enlist. We should stop all the mercenaries and their fighters who would want to come into the country. How could that be done? That will require cooperation between Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger. Also, the Multinational Joint Taskforce should be reorganized and strengthened to enhance the exchange of information between our borders. In the South, a lot of arms come through the creeks. To stop that, the waterways should be protected and patrolled.
Recently, many people were rescued from the Boko Haram by the military. Government should establish a rehabilitation centre, where psychologists and clerics would reorient these people, and then they should be given small-scale entrepreneurship training. Also, the National Orientation Agency (NOA), the Civil Society and the media should undertake security sensitization campaigns.
A lot have been said about the bombing incident that happened in Jaji in 2012, which led to your retirement from the army. What actually happened?
 

What happened in Jaji is now history and it marked the difference between individual's failure and system failure? If a system fails, it does not mean that an individual fails. As an individual, I did everything that was humanly possible to avert what happened.
I know Jaji inside out and every infantry officer should know Jaji, because it is the home of the infantry. I was an instructor, chief instructor and had four tours of duty in Jaji. I started going in and out of Jaji from the rank of a Lieutenant until I attained the rank of a Major-General. So I know how Jaji is. I was an instructor in jungle warfare and we used to go for exercises around that area. I was also an instructor in mountain warfare and later a chief instructor in tactics wing.
I have been commenting on and expressing concern about the Jaji area, asking for the training areas to be demarcated. I started making serious comments when I was a Colonel, serving as the chief instructor there. I recommended that we should have a place for exercises, like the Americans have in their school of infantry, which they call Yankee Road.
When I went back as the Corps Commander, Infantry, I instructed my intelligence officer to carry out a security survey of Jaji, which he did and handed in a report. I then forwarded suggestions of what to be done to the Army Headquarters. And we kept exchanging correspondences with the Army Headquarters over it.
Whenever I feel something is right, I pursue it so that I leave a mark for posterity. As I wrote to the Army Headquarters, I also wrote to the Kaduna State governor, the late Yakowa. I met him in the company of my staff officers and it was televised. He said he would get back to me, but that he would first discuss with the Emir of Zazzau.
For the Army Headquarters that had the responsibility to do the right thing, for reasons best known to them they didn't do.
I gave the Army Headquarters options of fencing the Jaji Cantonment or digging a deep trench around it and leaving only motorable roads, so that nobody can drive in on a motorcycle or vehicle. The last option was to construct watchtowers so that we could be deploying guards. The area was damn porous; from Rigachukun, you could enter Jaji through the backyard.
When I gave those suggestions, they were not acted upon. Instead, they said I should liaise with 1 Division Headquarters. I had an Engineer in Jaji and the GOC of 1 Division was my junior. Some of my staff officers were not happy but I said, ""No no, gentlemen that is the directive, we should comply. There is no humiliation in humility. If you are dining with the devil, you use a long spoon."" We wrote to the 1 Division and nothing was done. So, that is system failure.
One day, the Minister of Defence, Erelu Obada and the House and Senate committees on Defence came. I took the minister round and then showed her all the letters I have written. Incautiously she shouted, ""Me ooo! I'm tired of this military politics."" I pretended I didn't hear what she was saying.
The bottom-line is, that was how God wanted it to be. It was a design for some people to achieve certain purpose. But whatever it is, I believe that is how God wanted it and I don't want to go into it.
Was it a part of a plot to ease you out of the military?
Whatever it is, that was how God wanted it.
What was the finding of the panel that investigated the bomb attack?
In the military, when something happens they set up a Board of Inquiry. In Jaji, I was not the commandant. There was another Major-General as commandant of the Nigerian Army School of Infantry (NASI). I was only the Corps Commandant, Infantry and we have infantry in 1 Div, 2 Div, Army Headquarters garrison and 82 Div, all of them are infantry formations and I was their Corps commander. Apart from the commandant of NASI, there was a CO of a battalion who was in charge of the security there.
When this thing happened, I was not even in Jaji, I was on my way to Asaba in the company of AVM Umaru. We were together when I got a call and a text. Immediately after receiving the information, I briefed him and he asked, ""What will you do?"" and I said, ""Sir, I cannot drop you here. I will take you home before I turn back."" But I directed that the General (Commandant NASI) should not travel out, he should stay and I instructed my staff officers to go and I would be coming back. When I got back, I set up a Board of Inquiry. After setting it up, the Chief of Army Staff said he was going to set up his own, which was abnormal.
What did the Board of Inquiry find?
It was classified.
Did the Chief of Army Staff go ahead to set up his own Board of Inquiry?  

Yes, he set up his own.
Were you indicted?
I have not seen the report.
There was an allegation that an intelligence report was made available to you a day before the incident and you ignored it and travelled.
That is his (the Chief of Army Staff) own version and that was why I said, then, that we (me and him) should go to the Senate for a public hearing. But the truth is always there: between me and him who was fully aware of the situation? We should just leave it, as it is now history.
Who do you think was behind the Jaji attack? Was it Boko Haram?
I don't know.
Why did they target Jaji?
I don't know. They have their reasons. Whatever it is, they have their reasons. But all I'm telling you is I have worked in sensitive places. I was Staff Officer II Record in Military Secretary's office, which gave me access to the record of every officer, serving and retired, from N/1 Bassey (first indigenous commissioned officer). If you are not good, you can't work in that office. I was also the Chief of Administration, where I had access to the records of all subjects in the Nigerian Army. It is another very sensitive office.
Later as a General, I was Military Secretary. That is also is one of the most sensitive offices in the Nigerian Army. When I was a Brigade Commander in Kano, I organized a security seminar. Likewise when I was a GOC in Enugu, I organized a security seminar that brought together all the governors of the South-East and the South-South.
So, security is something that one has to take seriously,
Did the incident truncate your military career or were you due for retirement at the time?
As I said earlier, that is how God wanted it.
You instituted a lawsuit against the military over the incident. What happened to the case?
My lawyer, the late Yahaya Mahmud, demanded they should retract their comments against me, which they did. After I gathered all the facts, Yahaya Mahmud wrote him (Ihejirika) and he had to retract the statements, saying I'm his good friend and so on. Yes, when he was a Brigade Commander in Kaduna, I was a Brigade Commander in Kano and we knew ourselves right from the NDA (Nigeria Defence Academy). Also, when I was Chief of Administration, he was Chief of Standards and Evaluation.
How did you switch to civilian life and eventually join politics?
Being in the army does not mean that one does not have civilian friends. When I was a CO, I was a member of the state security council, so I interacted with a lot of civilians and wherever I served, I used to have civilian friends. Everywhere I served, I made civilian friends. Mingling with people depends on the type of person one is. If you distance yourself from people, you will find it difficult to get assimilated. So your personal relationship with people matters a lot and will assist you. Just be humble.
About three of you from Kebbi South, all with military background, contested for the governorship ticket of the PDP in Kebbi and you all lost. What happened?
I can only speak for myself. I was in my house in Kaduna when my Emir, the Emir of Zuru, sent the Chief of Dabai, that he wanted me to chair Ohola (our traditional ceremony) that year. I was furnished with the details and I told the chief that I felt honoured for the Emir to pick me from the Zuru Emirate as the one to chair the occasion. As final preparations were being made a day to the event, the Emir of Zuru met us at the place where pavilions were being erected.
He arrived while we were discussing politics, so he heard us. We were lamenting how the system has gone so bad, encouraging stealing and corruption. We talked about the way people who get to office concentrate recouping their investment first before thinking of development.
The Emir then asked me to see him before I proceeded to my local government. I asked the Chief of Dabai to accompany me and when we met him, the Emir told me that the state governor has asked him to tell me to contest for the governorship, that he had promised, during his second term campaign, to rotate the
 

governorship seat to the Zuru Emirate. Zuru has never produced a governor, deputy governor or even a minister. I told him I don't have the money for politics, but he said it is not a matter of money; it is for people to believe in you and for the government to agree. I said, ""Fine, let the will of God be done."" He asked me to confirm from the governor who was billed to attend the ceremony the next day. I was sitting by the governor the following day and I told him, ""Your Excellency I have received your message from the Emir."" He responded, ""Yes, yes"" and demanded that I meet him after the event to discuss it at the Governor's Lodge. When I met him, he confirmed it. That was why I came out to contest. Did you get his support as promised? No. Why? It is best known to him. What happened was that there was not even a primary election in Kebbi. When the primary was being held, Sambawa came to me and said, ""General I'm going home."" When I asked him why, he replied that everything was over, that it had been announced on Channels Television and AIT that somebody has won. I tried to point out that the primary was still on and Celestine Omehia was supervising it. We went and met Omehia, who cancelled the primary and promised to conduct it on another day. When it was scheduled for another day, they used soldiers and police to drive away delegates that came and thereafter published in the paper that somebody has won the election. So we said, this deception is too much and we went on air to clear our names. Who was declared the winner? Sarkin-Yaki Bello Was he the governor's new favourite? I don't know. Did you get back to the governor to know why he withdrew his support? I did not. Based on my relationship with him, he asked me to contest. I didn't do it on my own. Later we discovered that it was the same PDP gimmicks. We realized that there was not going to be justice and we all left to the APC. Some people had challenged your eligibility to rule the state, saying you are originally from Katsina State. What is your connection with Katsina? In the North, if somebody says he is from a particular village, go there and ask for his compound. If they can't take you to his compound, then he is not from there. First, I was a Brigade Commander in Kano and Katsina was under me. Second, I did my secondary school in Katsina and I have quite a good number of friends from there. It was out of political mischief that they said I'm an indigene of Katsina. Do you plan to pursue your governorship ambition in the future? It is only God that knows tomorrow. Whoever is planning against 2019 now is a daydreamer. I don't know if anybody doing that now has a covenant with God that he is going to reach 2019.","Why Sheikh Jafar Was Assassinated in Kano - - Major-General M.d. Isah (rtd) [interview]

15 May 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"15 May 2015 16:17 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved
Abuja, May 15, 2015 (The Guardian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The Presidential Committee on Continued Dialogue and Resolution of Security Challenges in the North has turned in its report to the Federal Government, offering far-reaching recommendations on how to end the insurgency and other related security challenges in the region.
Among other things, the report, which was obtained exclusively by The Guardian yesterday, called on the Presidency to grant amnesty to combatant members of the Boko Haram and Ansaru sects who renounced violence and were willing to disarm and re-integrate into the community. The same gesture was also proposed for those whose crimes or membership could not be proven.
President Goodluck Jonathan had, in opting for multi-faceted approach towards solving the problem of insecurity especially in the North East, constituted the subterranean committee to work outside the public view towards negotiating for ceasefire, amnesty and immobilisation of members of the terror group.
The constitution of the panel was one of the recommendations of the Presidential Committee on Dialogue and Peaceful Resolution of Security Challenges in the North headed by Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Alhaji Kabiru Tanimu Turaki, (SAN).
The Turaki-led committee had, while submitting its report to Jonathan on November 5, 2013 recommended among others the setting up of an advisory committee on continuous dialogues that will have powers to advise the President on all matters related to dialogue and resolution of crisis. It also recommended the setting up of a Victims Support Fund for victims of insurgency to be administered by a new agency established specifically to assist the victims.
The Guardian had in March last year reported exclusively on the empowering of the 10-man high-powered committee, also headed by the Minister of Special Duties/Inter-Governmental Affairs, which among other terms of reference, was to develop together with relevant agencies of government, a framework for the granting of amnesty; develop and implement together with relevant agencies of government, a framework for disarmament and further the development of strategies and mechanisms to address the underlying causes of insurgencies with a view to preventing future occurrences.
And if government accepts the recommendations of the committee, the framework used for the Niger Delta amnesty and disarmament programme may be studied to serve as a model.
The panel also recommended that for the famed hunters, 'civilian JTF' and other vigilante groups thatassisted in the fight against insurgency, they should be properly rehabilitated and catered for so that they do not constitute another security threat after the current war may have been won.
With the May 7, 2015 submission of the report of the committee to the Presidency, sources told The Guardian that there is not much the out-going government could do as regards implementation, thus leaving the incoming government of President-elect, Major-Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) the option of jettisoning or implementing it.
Part of the report reads: ""The centres should be under a committee comprising the military and other relevant stakeholders.
""Government should carry out adequate publicity so that members of the insurgents, who indicated substantial interest to renounce membership of the two sects and renounce violence, would not be arrested.
""There should be timely announcement of the grant of amnesty to encourage willing members of the sects to disarm. This would further weaken the position of unrepentant insurgents.""
 

In addition, the report stated that ""all contacts identified as vital to facilitating dialogue between the Committee and key members of the sects should be encouraged and granted amnesty. However, suspected criminals among them should be isolated and brought to justice to forestall encouraging criminal activities while those with light crime or believed to have been misled, should be granted amnesty.
Traditional ,religious and community leaders should advice on the best way to encourage those that were ready to disarm and benefit from the amnesty since they could easily reach out to people around them, including the insurgents.
""Detainees arrested without proof or evidence of involvement in the insurgency should be granted amnesty. Repentant insurgents who would benefit from the amnesty should be reintegrated and rehabilitated because most of them were jobless.
""Vocational training centres should be set up to train repentant insurgents on vocation jobs to enhance self-employment;
""The understanding and support of local communities should be enlisted because they could be agitated to allow the released repentant members of the sect to reintegrate into the community.
The report noted how the committee established contacts with 'reliable' members of the Boko Haram willing to give up armed struggle and stressed the need to negotiate with smaller or splinter insurgent groups that are willing to embrace dialogue and surrender their weapons.
The committee made a subtle reference to alleged interference from certain government officials in the execution of their assignment, and called for caution.
The report continued: ""Boko Haram and Ansaru sects should be disarmed simultaneously. However, in the event that only one of the armed groups is ready, then disarmament should proceed. The three frontline states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa should be the main focus of the disarmament programme.
""Mr. President should make a pronouncement to declare the commencement of the disarmament programme to lend credence to the programme as well as forestall contradictory statements by various Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). The disarmament programme should be situated in identified military barracks within the affected states.
""The major collection centre should be located in Maiduguri, while initial collection points should be sited close to the areas of the insurgency in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states before airlifting the weapons collected to a safer place outside the conflict areas, where the environment is considered safe for storage of the arms.""
It added: ""Adequate security should be provided at the collection points to prevent possible attempts to steal some of the collected weapons to ensure accountability. There should be incentives such as skills acquisition and vocational training as well as de-radicalisation programmes for the disarmed insurgents, subject to government policy, considering that the disarmament programme would not be linked to cash payments.
""There is need to interface with critical stakeholders, including those that participated in the Niger Delta disarmament programme so that the framework of the Presidential Committee on Niger Delta Amnesty and Disarmament programme could be studied to serve as a model.
""There is need to study the models of disarmament of other countries such as Ireland, Liberia, South Africa and Sierra Leone, among others, as well as visit some of these countries.""
The report harped on the need for comprehensive victim's support programme and the strategy for its implementation.
To this end, it recommended that medical facilities should be provided immediately to assist the victims.
""There is need to rehabilitate those who had lost property, business concerns or have been deformed by the insurgency. This should also be an immediate palliative. There is need to assist orphans of the insurgency and children whose parents are too poor to educate them, so as to prevent them becoming liabilities to the society. It also entailed rebuilding schools and other educational infrastructure.
""Employment should be used to assist the unemployed to set up small and medium scale business, in order to reduce the teeming unemployed youth that can be exploited by undesirable elements to instigate crisis in the society. Farmers should be assisted to procure fertilizers and other farm implements to facilitate their going back to farm,"" it stressed.","Presidential Panel Wants Amnesty for Boko Haram, Civilian 'JTF', Others

Liberians gathered in the streets of the capital on Monday to celebrate the end of the Ebola epidemic in this West African country.
The festivities come after the World Health Organization declared over the weekend that Liberia was finally Ebola-free.
More than 4,700 people died during the Ebola crisis in Liberia, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. Ebola continues to claim victims in Sierra Leone and Guinea, where health officials have had difficulty tracing new cases.

Saudi-led coalition hits Yemen on eve of truce
Warplanes from a Saudi-led coalition pounded weapons depots on the edge of Yemen's capital Monday, one day before a humanitarian cease-fire is due to start and a U.N. envoy arrives on his first visit to try to end the war.
The latest airstrikes followed the release by the Shi - ite rebels of video and photos of the purported wreck of a Moroccan F-16 that they claim to have shot down over the northern province of Saada near the Saudi border.
The Moroccan military said the plane had disappeared Sunday evening. An online news site with close ties to Morocco's royal palace and security and intelligence services said the aircraft was one of two that flew from a base in the United Arab Emirates on a reconnaissance mission over the Yemeni side of the border with Saudi Arabia.

Kerry visits Russia, first time since Ukraine crisis
Secretary of State John Kerry is heading to Russia to meet with President Vladimir Putin on his first visit to the country since relations between Washington and Moscow plummeted to post-Cold War lows amid disagreements over Ukraine and Syria.
The State Department said Kerry would meet Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday at the Black Sea resort of Sochi. But in a sign of the considerable strains, the Kremlin said Putin's attendance had yet to be confirmed.
""This trip is part of our ongoing effort to maintain direct lines of communication with senior Russian officials and to ensure U.S. views are clearly conveyed,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement.

Ex-President Carter: 'Bad cold' ended trip
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has made his first public appearance since cutting short an election observation visit in Guyana.
 

The 90-year-old ex-president told attendees of a summit at the Carter Center in Atlanta that he had a ""bad cold,"" according to remarks from the center on Monday morning. On Sunday, the center said Carter was returning to Atlanta a day early because he was not feeling well. Carter said Monday that he is fine and ""getting along well."" 10 Salem, Ore. Oregon governor signs bill to widen gun checks Oregon Gov. Kate Brown signed a bill Monday requiring background checks on firearm transfers between private parties, making Oregon the eighth state to require screening on nearly all gun sales. The law, which takes effect immediately, requires gun buyers and sellers who aren't related to visit a licensed gun dealer who can run a background check. ""We have an obligation to protect Oregonians from gun violence,"" said Brown, a Democrat. ""If we want to keep our kids, schools and communities safe we must make it harder for dangerous people to get guns."" 11 Tecumseh, Neb. Nebraska prison revolt leaves 2 inmates dead A weekend revolt at a Nebraska maximum security prison that saw inmates temporarily take control of half of the housing units left two prisoners dead, authorities said on Monday, probably killed by other inmates during the chaos. Four other prisoners were injured and two staff assaulted at Tecumseh State Correctional Institution about 60 miles southwest of Lincoln, which houses serious offenders including Nebraska's 11 death row inmates. Corrections Director Scott Frakes said the disturbance began at 2:30 p.m. on Sunday when about 40 inmates gathered in front of a housing unit. The two prison staffers were attacked when they tried to break up the gathering.","News NEWS BRIEFS

Good evening. I`m Gwen Ifill.
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I`m Judy Woodruff.
Also ahead this Monday: heavy artillery and rocket fire in Yemen. Clashes intensify ahead of a cease-fire that will allow desperately needed medical supplies and food aid into that war-torn nation.
GWEN IFILL: Liberia is declared Ebola-free. We talk to a doctor still coping with health problems after surviving the deadly virus.
DR. IAN CROZIER, Ebola Survivor: My brain failed, and my kidney failed, and my lungs failed. And I needed sort of a level of critical care that really had never been given to that degree before.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: an alarming increase in food allergies, and the experimental research showing promise to diminish the chance of a life- threatening attack.
DR. MICHELLE SANDBERG, Mother: These kids were being fully desensitized. Everything is completely normal. We buy any product we want. They eat the same snack at school as the other kids. At birthday parties, they go alone. They eat the cake, restaurants, everything.
GWEN IFILL: Those are some of the stories we`re covering on tonight`s ""PBS NewsHour.""
(BREAK)
JUDY WOODRUFF: The death toll rose to at least five today after a line of tornadoes ripped across five states on Sunday. Two people were killed in Nashville, Arkansas, and two others died around Van, Texas, 70 miles from Dallas, where three people were still missing.
People in Van spent the day picking up the pieces after nearly a third of the town was damaged or destroyed, including as many as a hundred homes. Scores of people were injured.
DEAN STONE, Mayor of Van, Texas: It`s a terrible thing for a city to come out like we did, but it`s a great thing the way the people have responded. We were here last night when it hit. We were here all night and we`re still here, and a bunch of them still are. We lost a lot of good properties, but it`s just something that you never expect, but we will be working on it diligently.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another death in Texas was blamed on flooding in Corsicana after 11 inches of rain fell over the weekend.
GWEN IFILL: The National Football League has suspended New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady for the four games next season. That follow league findings that Brady was -- quote -- ""at least generally aware"" that game balls were being deflated below standards. The Patriots will also pay a $1 million fine and forfeit two draft picks.
Residents of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, paid tribute today to two police officers killed over the weekend. Liquori Tate and Benjamin Deen were shot to death Saturday night during a traffic stop. Four suspects have been arrested. Initial court appearances were this afternoon.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jail records in Baltimore are raising more questions about how city police handle suspects. That follows the death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a severe spinal injury after his arrest and died. The Baltimore Sun reports that, since mid-2012, nearly 2,600 detainees were brought to jail with injuries too severe for them to be admitted.
 

GWEN IFILL: And the United States was forced to defend its record today on the use of force by police. The U.N. Human Rights Council cited high-profile cases involving the deaths of black suspects. It also pressed for abolishing the death penalty and closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.
JUDY WOODRUFF: European Union officials are now offering a plan for distributing the wave of migrants from North Africa and the Middle East. And the E.U.`s foreign policy chief laid out a separate plan today to cut off the flow of migrants.
Jonathan Rugman of Independent Television News reports.
JONATHAN RUGMAN: In the calm seas of the Mediterranean, another boatload of desperate migrants seeking sanctuary in Europe. Around 800 of them drowned last month, forcing Britain and its E.U. partners to treble the search-and-rescue effort.
This afternoon, the E.U.`s top diplomat appealed to the U.N. Security Council to back a new U.N. resolution authorizing force.
FEDERICA MOGHERINI, Foreign Policy Chief, European Union: The crucial thing for the European Union is destroying the business model of the trafficking and smuggling organizations, making sure that the vessels cannot be used again, making sure that the assets of these organizations are destroyed.
JONATHAN RUGMAN: But the Russians might veto a resolution. Destroying fishing boats would also mean destroying legitimate livelihoods. If a ship is flagged, you need the flag state`s permission to sink it, while traffickers can replace rubber dinghies easily and at little cost.
And though this man purports to be Libya`s prime minister, he is not internationally recognized as such.
PETER ROBERTS, Royal United Services Institute: There are two warring parties in Libya, so which one do you broach? And if you approach one and not the other, you get into debates.
(CROSSTALK)
JONATHAN RUGMAN: Well, are you saying this resolution is impractical?
PETER ROBERTS: Hugely impractical. It`s impractical and probably not deliverable by the military in any shape or form.
JONATHAN RUGMAN: But the alternative to sinking ships isn`t easy either. Follow the criminal money chain across Africa, end the continent`s wars, invest in its people, so that they no longer want to leave.
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, in Asia, well over 1,000 refugees from Bangladesh and Myanmar came ashore in Malaysia and Indonesia during the past few days.
Many are Rohingya Muslims fleeing discrimination in Myanmar. Authorities estimate 25,000 people attempted the voyage from January through March, twice as many as a year ago.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this country, lawyers for convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev rested in the penalty phase of the trial. Their final witness was Sister Helen Prejean, who wrote ""Dead Man Walking."" She`s met with Tsarnaev, and she says he appears genuinely remorseful. Closing arguments are Wednesday.
GWEN IFILL: Former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling was sentenced today to three-and-a-half years in federal prison in a high-profile leak case. He`d been convicted of telling New York Times journalist James Risen about a plan to disrupt Iran`s nuclear program.
JUDY WOODRUFF: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called today for a task force to investigate nail salons and for health regulations to safeguard salon workers. A New York Times series last week found many manicurists are being forced to work long hours, amid toxic chemicals, for surprisingly little pay.
GWEN IFILL: General Motors now confirms at least 100 people have died in crashes caused by faulty ignition switches in its vehicles. The announcement today said their families will be offered at least $1 million each in compensation. Another 184 people who were injured in crashes are also eligible for payments.
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on Wall Street, stocks could not maintain Friday`s rally. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 86 points to close near 18100. The Nasdaq fell 10 points, and the S&P 500 dropped nearly 11.
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the ""NewsHour"": Opening up the Arctic to offshore oil and gas drilling; fighting intensifies in Yemen as some, but not all, Arab leaders prepare to come to Washington; a doctor on life after personally surviving Ebola; promising new research to eliminate life- threatening reactions to food allergies;
 

the week ahead in politics with Amy Walter and Tamara Keith; and Denmark works with parents to stop the radicalization of their children.
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Obama administration has essentially cleared the way to allow Royal Dutch/Shell to begin drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Ocean this summer. It`s one of the most consequential and longawaited drilling decisions from the government. Shell is seeking approval to drill in the American portion of the Chukchi Sea off the coast of Alaska.
Environmental groups have long warned of the dangers of doing so. Estimates show there may be as much as 22 billion barrels of oil and 93 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the area.
Reporter Coral Davenport covers all this for The New York Times, and she joins me from its Washington bureau.
Coral Davenport, welcome.
Let`s -- help us understand a little better what area we`re talking about. Exactly where is it, how large is it, what does it look like?
CORAL DAVENPORT, The New York Times: Judy, it`s a very big portion of the Arctic Ocean.
The part that they`re looking at, where Shell`s leases are, are about 70 miles off the coast of Alaska. It is a pristine, untouched area. It is home to habitats of several rare species, large mammals, migrating habitats for whales, feeding habitats for walrus.
It`s also a very treacherous area, extreme storms, waves of up to 50 feet high, completely frozen over with ice in the winter. So this is a very remote, very treacherous, almost completely untouched area.
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, understanding the environmental objections, we know Shell has had difficulties in the past with some drilling in similar circumstances. What has Shell said it`s going to do to protect the environment?
CORAL DAVENPORT: So, this is not the first time the administration has given a go-ahead to Shell to drill in the area. It gave a permit to Shell to start exploring to see what`s in the area.
They went in, in summer of 2012. They were plagued that whole period with safety problems, operational problems. They had two rigs that went to ground that had to be towed away. The administration said that they wouldn`t reissue a permit to Shell until they had gone back, assured that they would upgrade their safety and operations procedures.
In the meantime, the administration had also put forth new drilling safety regulations that anyone drilling will have to follow. Environmental groups of course still say, despite all these promises, all these assurances and new regulations on the part of the administration, this area is just so treacherous to drill and so pristine that they fear that it`s still an accident waiting to happen.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what else should we know about why the administration has agreed to do this? Oil prices are certainly down. The supply is up.
What is the administration saying is a rationale?
CORAL DAVENPORT: Well, some of this is built in.
These areas, these federally owned portions of land were sold by the Bush administration to be drilled, to be leased. And so Shell paid for its lease to drill during the Bush administration. They applied for a permit to use that lease to go in and drill it.
If the Obama administration had ignored that permit or had, you know, just completely thumbed it down or denied it, Shell absolutely would have sued. If they were to have taken away the permit, they would have to give Shell back the money that it had paid for it, so some of this was just a matter of the Obama administration had to deal with what was on its plate.
Again, nonetheless, environmental groups are surprised and saying, could it have found some kind of way not to do this? It really is still a very striking -- striking piece of this president`s environmental legacy.
JUDY WOODRUFF: But this does, Coral Davenport, this essentially clears the way for this to happen. And we understand this summer, there is not much else that could take place in the meantime in the courts or elsewhere to stop this?
CORAL DAVENPORT: Right.
 

To be clear, what the administration gave today was a conditional approval. They cleared the last -- sort of second-to-last and certainly the last major hurdle for Shell to move forward. It gave it on condition that Shell made sure it gets the rest of some of its local and state-level permits. The company has said it`s moving forward with doing that. That will be the absolute final.
But people I have talked to said this is just sort of 95 percent of the way there. And the big piece that everyone was waiting for to see which way it would go was this decision by the Obama administration.
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right. It`s a story that everyone is -- I know is watching.
Coral Davenport with The New York Times, thank you.
CORAL DAVENPORT: Thanks so much, Judy.
GWEN IFILL: Fighting raged across Yemen today on land and in the air, in the countdown to a cease-fire.
In recent weeks, more than 1,400 people have been killed, and 150,000 forced to flee, in what`s become a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Warner begins our coverage.
MARGARET WARNER: Hours before the truce was to begin, Saudi armored vehicles moved toward the border, after clashing with Yemen`s Shiite Houthi rebels. There was no indication that any ground assault was imminent.
Meanwhile, a Houthi television channel showed the apparent wreckage of a Moroccan F-16 fighter jet, part of the Saudi-led aerial coalition. The Houthis said they shot it down, and showed what was purported to be the pilot`s I.D. card. Still, the bombing continued, with reports of a major coalition airstrike on a weapons depot in Yemen`s capital, Sanaa.
Marie-Elisabeth Ingres of Doctors Without Borders is in Sanaa, and says conditions are growing ever more dire.
MARIE-ELISABETH INGRES, Doctors Without Borders: The health system in general, it is collapsing. Because we didn`t receive any drugs for the chronic disease, for example, and because of the fuel, we have hospitals, some private clinics, they are not able now to run like before.
MARGARET WARNER: The same is true in the port city of Aden, where heavy street fighting raged today between Houthis and loyalists of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, now in exile in Saudi Arabia.
MOHAMMED AMIN, Yemen (through translator): We are living under siege, surrounded by these Houthis, no water, no electricity. The sewage is overflowing. Our children`s bellies are swollen and we have no medicine. We have nothing.
MARGARET WARNER: All this came as the clock ran down toward a five- day humanitarian cease-fire between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis, who have some backing from Iran.
On Saturday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani blasted the Saudis in a speech.
HASSAN ROUHANI, Iranian President (through translator): Saudi Arabia is a government that doesn`t understand and is not aware of the political situation of the region and the world and is a total beginner. It is trying hard to prove itself after many years.
MARGARET WARNER: The new Saudi king, Salman, has shown a more aggressive regional stance during his four months on the throne. And the efforts of the Sunni powers in the region, led by the Saudis, to counter Shiite Iran will be a top issue this week at a Gulf nation summit hosted by President Obama, also on that agenda, the U.S.-led talks with Iran on its nuclear program, the Syrian civil war, and the ongoing campaign against the Islamic State group.
Last Thursday, King Salman had told Secretary of State Kerry that he would attend. But, over the weekend, Salman and the king of Bahrain said they wouldn`t be on hand, sending other officials in their place. That left State Department spokesperson Marie Harf today to deny it`s a snub of Mr. Obama, triggered by Saudi concerns over the president`s pursuit of a nuclear deal with Iran.
MARIE HARF, Spokeswoman, State Department: King Salman made this decision, given what`s going on in Yemen. He`s sending the crown prince and the deputy crown prince, who are fully empowered. They run intel, they run defense, they run a lot of the areas that we`re actually going to be talking about in detail at Camp David. So we believe that the right mix of people will be there.
 

MARGARET WARNER: Right mix or not, the meetings begin Wednesday at the White House before moving to Camp David.
GWEN IFILL: And Margaret joins me now.
Margaret, we saw at the State Department, but at also the White House in the Briefing Room today very aggressive pushback of the notion that this was a snub, this last-minute decision not to come, especially on the part of the Saudi king. What really happened?
MARGARET WARNER: What happened was, remember when this was laid on by the White House, last month, right after coming up with this political framework for an Iranian nuclear deal.
And the hope was that, with the right assurances, the Gulf countries would at least give some sort of tacit approval to pursuing this deal. Instead, what the White House felt was a great compliment, being invited to the White House, Camp David, I`m told by people close to the palace in Saudi Arabia that King Salman felt he was being summoned to Washington.
He didn`t like being lumped in with all the GCC members. Then -- because Saudi Arabia should be first among equals. Then he -- after talking to Secretary Kerry and after the meeting in Paris on Friday, it became obvious he wasn`t going to get really the assurances he wanted, and that being from a culture where it`s rude for your host to say no, he didn`t really want to be kind of taken up to Camp David and then asked to sign something that he later would want to back off from.
GWEN IFILL: Now, the president did talk to him today to kind of smooth things over, we assume.
MARGARET WARNER: Yes.
GWEN IFILL: But at the root of this, Iran. Right?
MARGARET WARNER: At the root of this, Iran, and also the fact that the U.S. and the Saudis, despite all these years of at least some sort of partnership over oil and many other things, really don`t know how to -don`t understand each other very well.
But, yes, it`s not only that Iran after 10 or 15 years, whenever the negotiated time period expires, that Iran could be a nuclear weapons- capable state. It`s the Saudis fear that once the international community strikes a deal with Iran, Iran will, one, gain in stature and legitimacy, might even supplant the U.S. as a major partner in the region, and that, as sanctions are slowly lifted and it has more money, it will able to even better fund a lot of these groups, proxies that are destabilizing other countries in the region, whether it`s Shiite groups in Bahrain, whether it`s Hezbollah in Syria, whether it`s the Houthis in Yemen.
GWEN IFILL: And, well, let`s talk about Yemen a little bit, because I wonder if that`s partly also on the agenda for this weekend, or if there is anything that can be accomplished at this meeting in Camp David?
MARGARET WARNER: I think what the Saudis wanted was -- or at least certainly the UAE wanted -- was some kind of a mutual defense pact, almost like NATO.
And the Americans said they told them a couple of weeks ago that was a nonstarter, that wasn`t going to happen. But the U.S. is talking about not only selling them more weaponry, if that`s what they want, but helping the GCC develop greater capabilities to defend against all these unconventional threats, whether it`s cyber, whether it`s threats to their own oil infrastructure, and make it more interoperable with the U.S.
And there will be some sort of document that reaffirms the U.S. commitment to the security of its allies. For instance, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, the U.S. was in there. One person close to the Saudi culture who spent a lot of time there said, don`t underestimate the human factor here.
When the 79-year-old king was confronted with the idea that he had to get on a plane, fly to Washington, get on a helicopter, chopper up to Camp David, sit around in the woods, and then asked to sign on the dotted line, that`s not his idea of fun.
(CROSSTALK)
GWEN IFILL: May have been just as simple as that.
Margaret Warner, thanks again.
MARGARET WARNER: Thank you, Gwen.
JUDY WOODRUFF: This weekend marked a major milestone in the fight to end the Ebola outbreak. Liberia was declared Ebola-free after 42 days without a new case. Many took to the streets to celebrate.
 

And efforts are under way to rebuild schools, hospitals and other clinics. The disease has killed more than 10,000 people in West Africa, including 500-plus health care workers. While the outbreak has slowed considerably, there are new health complications for survivors.
Dr. Ian Crozier is one American health care worker who nearly lost his life while volunteering in Sierra Leone with the World Health Organization. After contracting the virus, he was evacuated to Atlanta`s Emory University Hospital and he eventually recovered. Months later, the virus was found in his eye and it nearly blinded him before a series of procedures and treatments. He is still experiencing a number of other symptoms.
And he joins me now.
And, Dr. Crozier, welcome. And we`re so glad to see you doing much better.
DR. IAN CROZIER, Ebola Survivor: Good afternoon. It`s a pleasure to be here. It`s a pleasure to be anywhere.
(LAUGHTER)
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tell us, first of all, how are you doing? It`s, what, been eight months since you were first diagnosed.
DR. IAN CROZIER: So, I`m doing remarkably well, given what I have been through.
First of all, I`m fortunate to be here and to be alive, and, secondly, to be looking at you through two fairly clear eyes is quite remarkable. So still struggling with a few symptoms that have been part of my sort of post-Ebola syndrome, but I`m doing much better than I was a few months ago. Thank you.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tell us briefly about what happened in your eye, and is it gone? Is the Ebola now gone from your eye?
DR. IAN CROZIER: So, in early December, I developed what we call uveitis. Forgive the medical-speak, but it actually reflected a great deal of inflammation inside the eye, to put it simply.
And once that began, it became obvious that it was going to be severe and that it was going to be sight-threatening. As part of my evaluation, because we were really worried about a risk for other viruses after a long hospital stay, Steve Yeh at the Emory Eye Clinic introduced a needle into the front room of my eye, the anterior chamber, and there he found incredibly, incredibly high numbers of active and replicating Ebola virus, which was a great surprise at the time.
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that was treated. And, today, you are much better, but, as I understand it, it may still be there.
DR. IAN CROZIER: Yes.
So, to get back to your question, I received some experimental treatment and a lot of anti-inflammatory medicine, steroids by mouth, steroids by injection into the eye, and topical steroids. And, unfortunately, to actually know for sure that the virus is no longer there, we would need to reintroduce that needle and tap the eye again.
And given the fact the pressures in my eye have been low, that procedure`s risks probably outweigh the benefits. That may come down the road. There is every indication, given the clinical improvement that I have had -- it really has been sort of a Lazarian return of the eye, that the virus is no longer there. But I can`t say that for sure.
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we -- it`s our understanding that it`s not contagious, though.
DR. IAN CROZIER: So, it`s very important to point out, actually, this was inside the eye, in the anterior chamber.
My tear fluids, the conjunctiva, which is outside the eye, those swabs were all negative, even at very high levels inside the eye. So, it`s important to point out that, even despite finding Ebola inside the eye, there`s no risk of transmission by casual contact.
This is important because Ebola survivors on the ground are facing a fair amount of stigma already. And I don`t want this finding to add to that difficulty.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, this was not only an enormous physical challenge for you, battling your way back, but it has to have also been a psychological challenge. You have spoken of having survivor`s guilt.
 

DR. IAN CROZIER: Yes, I suppose, though unwarranted, I have a fair amount of survivor`s guilt.
You know, if you had told me on day one of my symptoms that within a week, I would develop multisystem organ failure -- it`s an ominous term, but my brain failed, and my kidney failed, and my lungs failed. And I needed sort of a level of critical care that really had never been given to that degree before, especially in someone who survived.
As I was going through that, I`m, of course, incredibly grateful to the WHO and to the State Department. I would have been dead in a week, had I not received that care. But I`m also haunted a little bit by many of my patients and some colleagues and friends who didn`t have that opportunity, and that really reflects an inequity in global health that I think we`re all about trying to change for years now.
It`s particularly gratifying to me that this -- my eye case, which is really on the front edge of essentially a new disease -- we had a little signal back in the 1990s of some eye disease in survivors, but this is really a new disease in some ways. And so the fact that my case can hopefully directly and immediately and relevantly be translated to West Africa and prevent West African eyes from going blind is very gratifying, because I certainly struggle with holding those two things in tension.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I did want to ask you about that. You just -- you just went back to Sierra Leone a few weeks ago. And what did you find there?
And it is the case, as you say, that your own experience can be of help, as doctors try to figure out the post-Ebola difficulties that other survivors are having.
DR. IAN CROZIER: Yes. So, people are obviously taking care of survivors on the ground there.
And John Fankhauser at the ELWA Hospital, an SIM mission hospital, who has been caring for survivors for some time now and is in a sense one of on-the-ground expert, was seeing patients with eye disease. He invited a small team from Emory headed by Dr. Steve Yeh.
And we, within a short week, saw over 100 Liberian survivors with eye complaints. And though we need to learn a great deal about this disease, it is important. I think the window will be short in which to diagnose and to classify and to provide treatment for these eyes. And this really was the first look, in one sense, especially by Steve, who had fairly rapidly become the world`s expert in this disease.
And so we saw indeed that Liberian survivors, some portion of them are developing eye symptoms and some of those patients are developing sight- threatening disease. If we can change the natural history of that process, it will be remarkable and extremely gratifying to me, if my case can be useful that way.
You can imagine that a survivor who has, in a sense, survived their first death in the unit and come out and then faces the tragedy of a second death -- you know, going blind is not so far down the food chain from dying. And if we can change the natural history of that process, I would like to be part of that.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Dr. Ian Crozier, it is quite a journey you have been on. I know everyone is celebrating with you your remarkable recovery, but also listening to what you say about the lessons learned and what more has to be done.
Dr. Ian Crozier, we thank you.
DR. IAN CROZIER: Thank you, Judy.
GWEN IFILL: Now to the dramatic increase in food allergies, and what can be done about it.
You might recall the big news earlier this year, when scientists said that the best way to head off peanut allergies in children is to expose them to the nuts early on. But what about for those who already have allergies?
The ""NewsHour""`s Cat Wise, who has a personal connection to this disease, has our report.
CAT WISE: I have two young boys with life-threatening food allergies. A year ago, my older son ended up in the E.R. after accidentally eating a muffin with walnuts. Both boys are allergic to eggs, so cake at friends` birthday parties is not an option, much to their frustration.
Our experience is not unique. One in 12 American children has been diagnosed with a food allergy. The rate of those food allergies has doubled over the last decade. Every year, 90,000 people visit the E.R. with food allergy reactions, and nearly 200 die.
While some people outgrow their allergies, most are never cured. But that life sentence may be about to change.  

WOMAN: All right, Ms. Parker, how are we doing?
PARKER ANDERSON, Suffers Food Allergies: Good.
WOMAN: We`re going to do your food challenge today.
CAT WISE: Twelve-year-old Parker Anderson has been allergic to peanuts and tree nuts since she was a toddler. She`s come to Stanford University to enroll in a first-of-its-kind clinical trial, in the hopes that she may one day be able to eat nuts.
WOMAN: Alright, five milligrams. All right, a little bit on the lips. Don`t lick it off. OK? All right, how does that feel?
PARKER ANDERSON: Fine.
WOMAN: OK. No itching? Doesn`t tingle at all?
CAT WISE: Anderson, who spent five years on a wait-list to get here, is being given a small amount of one of the very foods she`s allergic to, pistachios. It`s the first step in a treatment she`s about to begin called oral immunotherapy to train her body not to react to nuts.
PARKER ANDERSON: Its a little scary, but I know that it will get better, like, over time. They`re going to desensitize me to all my allergies, so that I can start eating it normally, and not have to worry anymore.
DR. KARI NADEAU, Stanford University: You`re giving back the very same food the person is allergic to.
CAT WISE: Dr. Kari Nadeau is treating Anderson and the 300-some patients currently enrolled in trials. And she is the tour de force behind the food allergy research program at Stanford.
DR. KARI NADEAU: What are some of the foods you have always wanted to try that you haven`t so far? What`s your wish list?
PARKER ANDERSON: Oh, peanut butter banana smoothie.
DR. KARI NADEAU: Oh, peanut butter banana smoothie, OK.
Very carefully, we start with minuscule amounts of that food, and you give it at levels that won`t cause a reaction. And you give it to the person, make sure they`re doing OK, and then you tell them to take it every day for another two weeks. Then they come back in the clinic, and we dose you up here. Always, we increase the dose while you`re here in the clinic.
CAT WISE: A number of research institutions around the country, and even some private practices, are treating food allergy patients with similar methods.
But Dr. Nadeau has pioneered a way to treat people who have multiple allergies, up to five, at the same time. And she`s found a way to dramatically reduce the time it takes to desensitize patients through the use of an immune-suppressing asthma drug called Xolair.
DR. KARI NADEAU: We gave the Xolair, and then at eight weeks, we give that first dose of the food. It only takes about 16 weeks to 24 weeks then to be able to get someone up to a serving`s worth of food that would normally take two years to three years.
CAT WISE: In a small room in the clinic basement, known as the food pharmacy, nutritionist Katherine Lloyd has one of the most important jobs on the research team: ensuring patients get the right dose. She uses a highly sensitive scale to measure minuscule amounts of allergens. The smallest dose she distributes, 0.5 milligrams, is the equivalent of about 1/16th of a single peanut.
KATHERINE LLOYD, Stanford University: You just have to be very precise, because, if you give them too much, they may have a reaction. And I do kind of feel like a pharmacist down here, just measuring out. It`s almost as if I`m counting pills.
CAT WISE: On the day we visited, 4-year-old Hudson Brown, who has multiple food allergies, including peanuts, was getting one of those carefully prepared doses. He`s been in the trial since August and now eats about eight peanuts a day, with the help of some chocolate pudding.
WOMAN: This is your first bite of 2,000 milligrams. This is your maintenance dose. Ready? Oh, awesome. Don`t eat the spoon, though, OK?
 

CAT WISE: Nationally, based on a small number of studies that have looked at a small number of patients, it seems that Caucasians and Asians have a higher likelihood of developing food allergies, but much more research is needed, according to allergy experts.
At Stanford, more than 700 youth and adult patients have completed treatment since 2003. Nearly 90 percent have had their allergies go away, although Dr. Nadeau cautions it is too early to use the word cured. The remaining patients either moved away, stopped taking their doses regularly, or had unrelated health issues.
WOMAN: Oh, my goodness. Those are awesome breaths, dude.
CAT WISE: While no one has died or had a life-threatening reaction, the treatment is not an easy experience. In addition to being time- consuming, most patients at some point get stomach problems, skin rashes, or sore, itchy throats. But for those who stick with the program, the results can be dramatic.
BOY: I eat this one first. Then the cashew.
WOMAN: Yes.
BOY: Then the peanut, because that`s -- because this is what I like the best.
CAT WISE: Maya (ph) and Carly Sandberg (ph) were among the first patients to go through the multi-allergen studies with Dr. Nadeau.
WOMAN: At last, the biggest dose.
CAT WISE: They are now continuing to eat nuts several times a week to keep up their immunity, something that patients who complete the study are encouraged to do. Their mom, Michelle Sandberg, is a pediatrician, who says the results of the trial surprised her.
DR. MICHELLE SANDBERG, Mother: Initially, the goals were basically to decrease the risk of anaphylaxis. I never dreamed that there would be desensitization or a cure. But, as time passed, and as Dr. Nadeau saw the data, you know, these kids were being fully desensitized. Everything is completely normal. We buy any product we want. They eat the same snack at school as the other kids. At birthday parties, they go alone. They eat the cake, restaurants, everything.
DR. MICHELLE SANDBERG: OK.
CAT WISE: Oh, wow.
DR. MICHELLE SANDBERG: Yes.
CAT WISE: Lots of different kinds of nuts.
DR. MICHELLE SANDBERG: Pretty much every kind of nut.
CAT WISE: In fact, nuts are a big part of the family diet now.
It`s amazing for me, with my own kids having nut allergies, to see this.
DR. MICHELLE SANDBERG: Now, actually, my goal is to get as much nuts into my kids as possible.
CAT WISE: Dr. Nadeau`s research efforts recently got a big boost. Silicon Valley entrepreneur and Napster co-founder Sean Parker, who has severe food allergies, donated $24 million to Stanford to advance scientific understanding of the disease.
In the lab that now bears Parker`s name, Dr. Nadeau has a team of scientists working on a variety of experiments aimed at understanding the underlying causes of allergies.
DR. KARI NADEAU: We are where cancer therapy was 20 years ago. There`s a black box right now behind what is the cause of allergies, and how can we improve and treat allergies? And that`s exactly what we`re studying in the lab on the cell level, on the DNA level, but, importantly, is that we do our science to directly, in real time, help people with the disease.
CAT WISE: Its research that may one day aid my own children, and the millions like them with food allergies.
DR. KARI NADEAU: Many families, in fact all of them, they live 365 days in fear. They really live a life where they observe life, and rather than live it. And so at the end of the study, what I would really like to be able to accomplish for those families is so they can live life, so a child doesn`t have to sit out of a birthday party, and be on the side eating their own type of food.
 

CAT WISE: And she hopes, if things go according to plan, Parker Anderson might just be able to eat that peanut butter banana smoothie she`s been craving later this year.
For the ""PBS NewsHour,"" I`m Cat Wise in Palo Alto, California.
GWEN IFILL: It`s family feud time for both Republicans and Democrats, as presidential candidates look for ways to stand out in a crowded field, and liberals go to war with the White House over trade.
It`s also Politics Monday, so Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report and Tamara Keith of NPR are here to sort it all out for us.
Let`s start with the Republican feud. Remember ""Spy vs. Spy"" in ""Mad"" magazine? This is GOP vs. GOP. OK, so we heard Rick Santorum at a meeting this weekend, another one of the Republican cattle calls.
And this is -- let`s just listen from -- first to what he had to say.
RICK SANTORUM (R), Former U.S. Senator: The Republican Party nominated people who have checked one of three boxes. Number one, you were a vice president. We have nominated former vice presidents. Number two, you were the son of a former president.
(LAUGHTER)
RICK SANTORUM: And, number three, you came in second the last time and ran again.
GWEN IFILL: Of course, he came in second when, and is running -- and is possibly running again?
Rick Santorum hasn`t announced he`s running for president, but he clearly sees part of his path is to take down the others.
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political Report: Right. And so really he`s saying is, it`s between Jeb Bush and Rick Santorum.
OK. I`m glad we cleared that all up. We`re done. We don`t need to talk anymore about Republicans. I`m sort of defining the Republican field right now. It`s like the dating game, all right, where you have Republican primary voters are in no mood to settle down. In fact, they`re happy, I think, with this big field of potential candidates.
And they want to date and meet people. They`re not ready to get married yet. So, each one of the candidates then goes to these cattle calls -- I`m going to be at one in Iowa this weekend -- and tries to make the best case to these -- hope -- to their suitors. But I don`t think we are going to end up any time soon with an obvious candidate or two candidates, in the way that Rick Santorum would like to present it.
I think this field is going to stay as crowded as it is for some time. And it`s going to be the debates and it`s going to be the actual contests that winnow it down.
GWEN IFILL: Tamara?
TAMARA KEITH, National Public Radio: They`re all trying to stand out in a very, very crowded field. And they`re doing that. All of the governors are saying, well, you don`t want another senator, do you?
And all the senators are saying, well, don`t -- you don`t want a governor. You want somebody with foreign policy experience. They`re all trying to differentiate themselves. In reality, each one is going to get a little pop when they announce. And then they all sort of, like, tumble back into the field.
GWEN IFILL: And then you see them doing things like competing for subsets of the Republican vote, in this case especially the evangelical vote, because there is just not one candidate who can corner that market.
This weekend, we saw Jeb Bush at Liberty University, the Christian school in Virginia, giving a commencement speech. And we saw Scott Walker, who also hasn`t announced he`s running, but people think he is, the governor of Wisconsin, in Israel wearing a yarmulke and appealing in that way.
AMY WALTER: That`s right.
So, the thing is, you don`t win the nomination, the Republican nomination if you are not in line with the evangelicals socially and culturally. If you`re too far outside of that realm, you`re not going to win. At the same time, if you`re too closely aligned, you get pigeonholed as an evangelical candidate, you are probably not going to win either.
 

This is the place where Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee were stuck in the last two elections. They got pigeonholed as, well, they can appeal to this one subset, but they don`t really appeal broadly. When I talk to those campaigns now, they`re spending all this time saying, why don`t people take us seriously on other issues? We`re talking about so many other issues.
So it`s finding that balancing point of, you don`t want to turn -- you can`t be too far to the left, but you also can`t turn off the moderate voters.
GWEN IFILL: But, Tamara, is it possible to split that too finely so that nobody gets anything?
TAMARA KEITH: There are so many of them competing for that tiny...
GWEN IFILL: Right.
TAMARA KEITH: The evangelical share of the Republican Party isn`t really that big.
They have an outsized role, in particular in Iowa, which happens to be the first-in-the-nation caucus. And so there`s a lot of tailoring to that group. But, I mean, if we`re looking at Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee -- Jeb Bush went to Liberty University. Ted Cruz announced at Liberty University. Bobby Jindal is working that angle too.
(CROSSTALK)
GWEN IFILL: If you`re at Liberty University, when they go home for the summer, they`re going to not...
TAMARA KEITH: Where are they going to do their events?
GWEN IFILL: Where are they going to go?
(LAUGHTER)
GWEN IFILL: Let`s go to the Democratic family feud on the other side.
And it`s all about this Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which they`re waiting to see if Congress will allow the president to have the fast track to approve. And in this case, it`s the president at war against his own people.
Let`s listen to what he had to say, in particular in an interview this weekend with Yahoo! News in which he talked about Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, who has been kind of leading the fight against it.
BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States: Elizabeth is a politician like everybody else. And she has got a voice that she wants to get out there. And I understand that.
And, on most issues, she and I deeply agree. On this one, though, her arguments don`t stand the test of fact and scrutiny.
GWEN IFILL: Fact and scrutiny.
Her response, of course, in an interview today The Washington Post, with a blog in The Washington Post, was to say that: ""The president has committed only to letting the public see this deal after Congress votes to authorize fast track. At that point, it will be impossible for us to amend the agreement or to block any part of it without tanking the whole TPP. The TPP is basically done.""
So the two of them are taking these little shots across the bow to each other over a pretty big issue.
AMY WALTER: It is.
And the good thing and the bad news for Democrats at this point in history is they`re the most ideologically unified that we have seen them in years. That`s great if you`re the president presiding over a unified party, except when you want to go against party orthodoxy, in this case a trade deal.
And labor unions are going to be very upset with you, liberals very upset with you. At the same time, he doesn`t have many moderates left in his party. They have all been wiped out in the last two wave midterm elections. So, this is -- as I said, it`s good when you are all on the same page and you can pass legislation that everybody agrees on.
But when you`re the president and you try to go against the tide, this is what`s going to happen.
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.  

And the president is lobbying hard. He has to win over his own party on this. And Elizabeth Warren, I think, has the advantage of speaking for most of the people in her party on this particular issue.
And I will just say that she`s also going to be on ""Morning Edition"" tomorrow talking with Steve Inskeep. She phoned in, which is to say full- court press from Elizabeth Warren. She`s not backing down on the president.
(CROSSTALK)
GWEN IFILL: We will be listening, Tamara. Nice plug.
(LAUGHTER)
GWEN IFILL: I want to ask you, though, where`s Hillary Clinton in this? Because she has been kind of mysteriously quiet in a pretty big intraparty fight.
TAMARA KEITH: She was asked about trade like two or three weeks ago in New Hampshire. She didn`t directly even answer the question.
She sort of indirectly answered the question. And she`s been silent on it ever since, in part because she doesn`t get to ask -- she doesn`t take a lot of questions from the media, or, well, like pretty much any.
GWEN IFILL: And it`s a lose-lose proposition for her to even step into that voluntarily.
TAMARA KEITH: No way. No, I wouldn`t volunteer for that.
GWEN IFILL: OK. Tamara Keith of NPR, we will be listening. And Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report, we will be reading.
AMY WALTER: Thank you.
TAMARA KEITH: Thank you.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight: combating extremism in Europe.
Denmark is often referred to as the happiest place on earth, but its sense of peace and serenity was shell-shocked earlier this year when an Islamic extremist shot and killed two people in Copenhagen. The country, like other European nations, is struggling to stop its citizens from joining the Islamic State group and other terrorist organizations in Syria.
""NewsHour"" special correspondent Malcolm Brabant caught up with one devastated mother who is urging the government to do more to stop the tide of extremism.
Right now, I`m just looking for more videos to see if I can get any knowledge about my boy.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Karolina Dam`s worst fear came true in the cruelest way. An Islamic State death notice on Facebook alerted her to news that her eighteen-year-old son, Lukas, had been killed in an American airstrike on the Syria-Turkey border.
KAROLINA DAM, Mother: I need peace and quiet now. I need to get on. I need -- I don`t want him dead. But I need -- I need to know things. And I don`t know if he`s alive. I don`t know if he`s in jail or if ISIS has killed him. I don`t know anything. It`s hard. You can`t sleep. I wake up with nightmares everywhere.
MALCOLM BRABANT: But you don`t believe he`s alive, do you?
KAROLINA DAM: No.
MALCOLM BRABANT: How strong was the evidence that he was killed?
KAROLINA DAM: There`s no evidence.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Lukas had attention-deficit disorder, and, according to his mother, suffered from relatively serious autism.
After dabbling in petty crime, he was put in a home for vulnerable teenagers. He became a Muslim a year after this video was taken.
KAROLINA DAM: I don`t want to classify my son as a terrorist, because he`s not. My boy is the victim in all this. He has been manipulated. He has been abused and pushed into this fight that he and others have won.
 

MALCOLM BRABANT: Lukas fell under the spell of hard-line groups like Hizb ut Tahrir, an international party that campaigns for Sharia law and a worldwide caliphate.
MAN: So, first of all, I would like to tell the enemy to look very closely at this flag, at the black flag, not the white flag, but the black flag, because this is the black flag that the U.S. will see. This is the black flag that the U.S. will see coming over the horizon. This is the black flag they will see coming across the Atlantic in front of an army that loves the prophet, that loves Islam.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Mrs. Dam said she did everything in her power to prevent her son from traveling to Syria. She took away his passport and alerted his social workers.
KAROLINA DAM: It`s not the easiest task for a parent to keep on calling the authorities. But it is the right thing. The wrong thing is them not doing anything about it.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Mrs. Dam went to Copenhagen`s city hall to try to get some answers from one of the deputy mayors. No officials were prepared to talk on camera.
Mrs. Dam had received an apology from city hall for the failings of the system. Official admitted that social workers should have alerted Copenhagen`s de-radicalization program to fact that Lukas Dam was in danger of going to Syria, so that he could have been stopped at the airport. But the program wasn`t informed until four months after Lukas left the country.
Sources within city hall tried to shift the blame on to Denmark`s intelligence agency, claiming it was twice tipped off about the Lukas Dam case. The agency has refused to comment.
But Professor Magnus Ranstorp was willing to discuss the issue. He heads the Copenhagen Anti-Radicalization Task Force, which is due to deliver an action plan in August.
MAGNUS RANSTORP, Copenhagen Anti-Radicalization Task Force: We were looking at, how can we improve the system? How can we involve civil society more? How can we can we involve parents as well? So we are looking over the system to see how we can -- how we can be more efficient.
MALCOLM BRABANT: This is a recruiting video for the so-called Islamic State, and the key figure is the 21-year Dane to the right of the picture. Like Lukas Dam, he was a Christian convert with learning difficulties named Victor Kristensen.
After appealing to his Danish brothers and sisters to join jihad, Victor blew himself up in a suicide attack. He was radicalized at this mosque.
As part of the nationwide effort to neutralize extreme Islamic rhetoric, this Muslim lawmaker, Fatma Oktem, wants to ban certain radical preachers.
FATMA OKTEM, Denmark Parliament Member: We know that the young people are visiting the mosques and they are listening to the religious leaders. So it`s very important that people who are talking about religion can talk about peace and harmony and integration, not about hate.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Lawmakers are deeply concerned about the rising influence of groups like Hizb ut Tahrir and are disappointed that Danish prosecutors have just ruled that it can`t be outlawed, as it is in countries like Germany and Russia.
SOREN ESPERSEN, Danish People`s Party: We ought to make sure that Hizb ut Tahrir is forbidden in this country, as they are in many other countries. And I think that the various ministers of justice have failed, because, in our relation, in our constitution, it says that those kind of groups that work for violence and in a way push for violence should be closed.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Hizb ut Tahrir insists it is not breaking any laws, and attributes its rising popularity amongst young Muslims to what it describes as Denmark`s anti-Islamic policies.
ELIAS LAMRABET, Hizb ut Tahrir: It`s a clear sign of intellectual bankruptcy in the Danish Parliament, because they cannot withstand thoughts with thoughts. They cannot counter arguments with argument. This is really what we are used to in dictatorships and the like.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Denmark has changed dramatically since the Valentine`s Day shootings that killed filmmaker Finn Norgaard at a free speech forum and security guard Dan Uzan at Copenhagen`s synagogue.
There is a sense the country has lost its innocence. Before the attacks, security used to be very discreet. Now the police are overstretched on full alert in case of a new atrocity. These officers were deployed to protect a Jewish deli close to a mainly Muslim district after it was vandalized.
 

The Valentine`s Day shooter, Omar El-Hussein, killed by police in a brief exchange of fire, was a hero for a significant number of Muslims. The government here is investing tens of millions of dollars in various deradicalization programs to try to dampen enthusiasm for extreme Islam displayed at his funeral.
If they return to Western Denmark and the police fail to find evidence that they committed crimes in the Middle East, they will be offered a place on a rehabilitation program.
JORGEN ILUM, Commissioner, East Jutland Police: We don`t roll out the red carpet. But we are there to try to help them reintegrate into the society, because we believe that is the most secure thing we can do in order to protect society from these young people becoming even more radicalized.
MALCOLM BRABANT: One person with an insight into the minds of the jihadis is Morten Storm, a former Islamic radical who claims to have worked as a double agent for the CIA and helped them target al-Qaida leaders in Yemen.
MORTEN STORM, Former Islamic Extremist: I think the authorities have been naive. At the same time, I think it`s a disgrace. I think that they are underestimating the ideology and the motivation of these people.
MALCOLM BRABANT: After her city hall meeting, Karolina Dam talked to one of the officials involved in Copenhagen`s de-radicalization program. She curses the Islamic extremists who brainwashed her son and hopes that others can be saved.
KAROLINA DAM: I can`t do anything about it now. I can do whatever I can to help them prevent it happening again. And that would be in the spirit of my son. That`s what I need to do.
MALCOLM BRABANT: In the meantime, Mrs. Dam has little alternative but to continue her lonely search among the Islamic State videos online, despite ISIS` announcement that Lukas was killed.
For the ""PBS NewsHour,"" I`m Malcolm Brabant in Copenhagen.
GWEN IFILL: On the ""NewsHour"" online: NASA`s Mars Curiosity recently captured an image that was so inspiring, it tweeted about it in a poem. The space rover, which has been analyzing Martian soil since 2012, caught a glimpse of a stunning blue sunset from the Red Planet. You can see those photos, on our home page. That`s on our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pretty cool.
GWEN IFILL: Very cool.
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that`s the ""NewsHour"" for tonight.
Tomorrow: how artificial intelligence is helping your doctors treat you.
I`m Judy Woodruff.
GWEN IFILL: And I`m Gwen Ifill.
Join us online and again here tomorrow evening. For all of us here at the ""PBS NewsHour,"" thank you, and good night.

Apr 30, 2015 (Liberian Observer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- When President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf tapped CSA boss George Werner to head the Ministry of Education, it came as a surprise to many and perhaps the question on their minds was, ""Is he the right one for the job?"" The question stems from the fact that many of the ""old and experienced hands"" could not deliver on the task given them.
The Liberian education system is emerging from a prolonged and brutally destructive period of civil unrest. Liberia is significantly behind most other countries in the African region in nearly all education statistics.
After 14 years of civil war, which resulted in the destruction of much of the country's trained workforce, the country is still in the process of rebuilding its educational system, according to the USAID.
To compound it all, in 2013, 25,000 persons who sat the University of Liberia exams failed miserably that it caught the attention of the world. President Sirleaf finally had to admit that the system is a ""mess and requires a complete overhaul.""
That Liberian students could not pass a university entrance without garnering headlines around the world for all the wrong reasons meant our education system has indeed faltered and is no longer in its pre-war years when it was second to none.
And even after the cessation of hostilities twelve years after and the appointments of seasoned educators, that sector continues to take a nosedive.
And so many are wondering about the background of the newly appointed minister and what has he to offer to our already broken system. Education, it seems, has been the lifeblood of this young man nearly all his life.
George Werner holds a BA in Education from the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome and a Master of Arts in social work (concentration in social policy) from the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice while earning a cumulative GPA of 3.80. To sum it up, he studied didactics, (which is the science of teaching) as a one year non degree course at the University of South Africa, Pretoria. And he has taught across the world from Liberia, South Africa and the United States of America.
Prior to his appointment, he currently serves a Director general of the Civil Service Agency, one of the many government agencies that was dogged by the issues of ghost names, salaries etc. He spearheaded the Civil Service reform in an effort to regularize the civil service, optimize the size of government and professionalized the workforce for improved service delivery.
Lest we forget that he currently oversees the inter-ministerial scholarship from bilateral partners and under his watch, scholarships are given on merit, unlike the yesteryears when the doling out of scholarships was mired in the patronage system.
As mentioned supra, President Sirleaf has already claimed that our education system is a mess. And now that herculean task of dry cleaning that mess rests squarely on the shoulders of George Werner and his team of lieutenants.
First, he has to use his magic wand to clear the names of ghost teachers on the payroll, teachers receiving their salaries on time so it doesn't obstruct teachings and teachers who are yearning for employment but are yet contracted.
Then there's the issue of competency of the teachers. Having an undergraduate degree doesn't necessarily mean you are qualified to teach. Teaching, like any profession, has ethics that govern the teachers.
Due to the fact the many of our teachers eschew teacher training, the line of demarcation between a teacher and a student, howbeit thin, is hardly ever seen. Hence, there are always reports of intimacy between  

teachers and students. Few years ago, a teacher of Cathedral Catholic School was remanded at the Monrovia Central Prison for having an intimate relationship with an underage female student. This is one area the incoming minister will have to apply fifty shades of gray. In order for a student to compete with students from around the globe, he/she must be taught from a rather strong curriculum. Truth be told, Liberia's education curriculum is antiquated. When the trial exams of West African Senior School Certificate Examination were administered, it was only Elvis Juasemai, a student of the Soltiamon Christian School System, emerged by the skin of a flea with flying colors. Another issue constantly overlooked but can certainly be given the limelight when Werner takes office is the absence of extracurricular activities in our schools. Extracurricular activities are those that fall outside the realm of school or university education. Most times students go into university without knowing what to do. That's because they never found their niche in high school, thanks to the lack of extracurricular activities in these schools. In a commentary titled, ""Neglecting Extra-curricular Activities Could Perpetuate Poor WAEC Results,"" Liberian journalist Momolu Dorley laments: ""Extra-curricular activities is a crucial component to education in any successful country because it allows the student to learn about theatre, about passion, imagination and self-discovery. I am of the conviction that one of the joys of education is letting folks discover the pleasure of learning for them."" As a former teacher, Werner understands fully the significance of extracurricular activities and its contribution to the growth and development of students cannot be over emphasized. Werner has an ambitious plan to get the education sector better than what it was during the prewar years. To have a smooth sailing, he needs the support of all and sundry. Currently, government spends 12% of its annual budget on education, a paltry sum when one compares it to Ghana which currently spends 33% of its annual budget on education. Yes, the expectations are high and to whom much is given, much is also expected but we must be reminded by the words of the French playwright artist Jean Baptiste Poquelin, also known by his stage name as Moliere: ""trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruits."" About the author: Gboko John Stewart, a product of Monrovia College, is a freelance journalist and radio talk show host. He has been accepted to study at Quest University Canada. He runs an online petition on change.org and has gathered over 1000 signatures calling on the Canadian government to lift its visa ban on Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone so that he and others can travel there for studies.","'Trees That Are Slow to Grow Bear the Best Fruits' [opinion]

IRAQ After two days of U.S. airstrikes, an Iraqi military spokesman says Iraqi security forces and Kurdish fighters have retaken control of the country's largest dam from the hands of Islamic militants who captured it less than two weeks ago. The development marks the first major victory for Iraqi and Kurdish troops since U.S. airstrikes began earlier this month and could significantly boost their morale as they try to free territory overrun by the Islamic State group in a blitz this summer.

2 April 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"2 April 2015 19:14 Xinhua News Agency XNEWS English Copyright 2015. Xinhua News Agency. All rights reserved. UNITED NATIONS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council on Thursday adopted a resolution authorizing the drawdown for the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). According to the resolution, UNMIL's force levels will be cut to 3,590 military personnel and 1,515 police personnel during the current mandate period, which expires Sept. 30, representing a 25 percent reduction and a 16 percent cut from the levels authorized and adopted on Dec. 15, 2014, respectively. The resolution also highlighted the Council's concern about border security, particularly between Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire. It called on the governments of the two countries to ""continue reinforcing their cooperation, particularly with respect to the border area."" The resolution also reaffirmed the Council's expectation that the government of Liberia will assume full responsibility for security from UNMIL by June 30, 2016. UNMIL was set up in 2003 to bolster a ceasefire agreement after a civil war killed almost 150,000 Liberians -- mostly civilians -- and forced some 850,000 others to flee to neighboring countries. The UN Security Council extended in December the mandate of UNMIL for another nine months until Sept. 30, 2015 so that the mission can continue to provide humanitarian assistance and electoral support as well as human rights promotion and protection there.

Hello everyone. Bonjour.
**Press Conference Today
At 12:30, Ambassador Francois Delattre, Permanent Representative of France and President of the Security Council for the month of March, will be here to brief on the programme of work for this month.
**Libya
From Libya, the UN Mission there (UNSMIL) today announced that the next round of political dialogue will take place later this week in Morocco.
The mission says that the parties have formally communicated their decision to take part in the dialogue following close consultations with Special Representative of the Secretary-General Bernardino Leon during his visit to Tobruk and Tripoli yesterday.
This week's talks will focus on the formation of a government of national unity, security arrangements to pave the way for a comprehensive ceasefire, and completion of the constitution drafting process within clear timelines.
Mr. Leon is expected to brief the Security Council tomorrow morning by video link and we will provide more details on the talks as soon as they are available.
**Sri Lanka
The Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Jeffrey Feltman, today wrapped up a visit to Sri Lanka.
Mr. Feltman met with the President, Prime Minister, and acting Foreign Minister, as well as with leaders of political parties, diplomats and civil society representatives.
Speaking to reporters in Colombo, he said that the country's democratic elections and peaceful transition have not only inspired the citizens of Sri Lanka but also captured the attention of its many friends in the international community.
On the country's speech to the Human Rights Council yesterday, Mr. Feltman said that he was encouraged by the Government's commitment to promote reconciliation, accountability and human rights, which, he said, is very much in line with the 2009 joint communique.
Mr. Feltman also encouraged national leaders and political stakeholders to work on issues of trust between communities in the spirit of inclusion and consultation. He said that, as requested by Sri Lanka, the UN is committed to assisting in the process of accountability and reconciliation.
His full press statement is available on the counter in our office.
**Ebola
The Secretary-General's Special Envoy on Ebola, David Nabarro, participated today in the high-level international Ebola conference in Brussels.
He said that the phase 2 of the response -- where we are now -- is the hardest part and a bumpy road. He added that all must remain fully engaged until the task is completed, especially as the virus is moving and as some communities are reticent about being engaged in the response.  

Dr. Nabarro stressed that communities engage if they trust responders and that the 22 million people living in the affected countries need to be able to access the employment, markets and services that enable them to stay healthy.
He added that a gap of around $900 million remained to fund the response in the next six months, with $400 million urgently needed for critically important activities to get to zero cases.
Also in Brussels today, the Head of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), Helen Clark, called for international support to the three most affected countries -- that's Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea, of course -- so that serious development setbacks are as short lived as possible.
You can find a copy of her full remarks on UNDP's website.
And you will have followed yesterday the ""Stop Ebola and Build for the Future"" concert. In his remarks before the event, the Secretary-General said that Ebola can be beaten but that nobody can afford to drop their guard, as the outbreak began with one case and will not be over until all countries are totally free of Ebola.
His full remarks are online also.
**Somalia
The Secretary-General's Special Representative for Somalia, Nick Kay, and the Special Representative of the African Union Commission Chairperson today made a joint call for increased measures to protect Somalia's women and girls. They reiterated their commitment to support efforts to combat sexual and gender-based violence in Somalia.
They also highlighted the importance of providing better, more timely and comprehensive assistance, including health and psychosocial care, to victims of sexual violence and their families.
And there is more information on that available online.
**Nigeria/Cameroon
From Geneva, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) reports that some 16,000 Nigerian refugees fled to Cameroon's Far North region over the weekend to escape clashes in north-east Nigeria between regional military forces and insurgents.
Starting tomorrow, the Agency will work with Cameroon to relocate refugees to a transit site at Kousseri, 90 km from the border. These refugees will then be transferred to a camp in Minawao.
UNHCR also says that given the evolving security situation and the prospect of more refugee arrivals, the possibility of setting up a second refugee camp is being considered.
**Statistics
The Deputy Secretary-General addressed the 46th session of the United Nations Statistical Commission today.
Noting that the lack of data is affecting poor and marginalized communities unfairly, Mr. Eliasson stressed that in a new era of development, the need for data and information will have to go beyond what statistical offices are currently doing in each country. He added that it will require new ways of gathering data, new data-based partners, new users and new policies for better lives.
The Deputy Secretary-General highlighted that the post-2015 development agenda is our opportunity to make this a living reality for every person on the planet.
His remarks and more information about the session are also available online.
**Narcotics
The International Narcotics Control Board, or INCB, has warned that three quarters of the world or an estimated 5.5 billion people worldwide have limited or no access to pain relief medications.
According to the INCB Annual Report for 2014, which was released today, around 92 per cent of morphine used worldwide is consumed by only 17 per cent of the world population. The INCB added that Governments have an obligation to address the discrepancy in the availability of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical and scientific purposes.
 

The report also pointed out that natural disasters and armed conflicts can further limit access to essential medicines, and reiterated that under international humanitarian law, parties to armed conflicts have to allow access to medicines and medical care for the civilians in territories under their control.
**Honour Roll
Finally, the honour roll: Ecuador and Turkmenistan have paid their regular budget assessments, bringing the number of Member States who have paid in full to 52.
**Press Conferences Tomorrow
Tomorrow at 11:00 a.m., there will be a briefing here by the Head of the Azerbaijan International Development Agency. This briefing is being sponsored by the Permanent Mission of Azerbaijan.
Then at around noon, the guests at the noon briefing, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction, Margareta Wahlstrom, and the Lead Author of the Global Assessment Report (GAR) on Disaster Risk Reduction, Andrew Maskrey.
**Questions and Answers
Associate Spokesperson: That's what I have for you. We have a few minutes for questions before the Ambassador Delattre comes here. So any questions? No? That's great. Okay. Then we're done. Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Matthew.
Question: Sure. Thanks a lot. First, I guess I wanted to ask, OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) seems to have tweeted today they're extending Valerie Amos for two months. I wonder if you could explain -- she was going to leave at the end of March. And also if you can explain, this selection process, Steven O'Brien, a UK candidate, will be interviewed today by the Secretary-General.
Associate Spokesperson: On the selection process, I have nothing to confirm. On Valerie Amos, yes, she did agree to a short extension in her current post as Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator. I believe it is until the end of May. The reasoning is that she wants to see the third Kuwait Pledging Conference through and make sure there's a smooth transition with her successor.
Question: But will a successor be named before the end of March as had been planned or is it... because most people see this as basically the decision couldn't be made. Will the decision be made?
Associate Spokesperson: I really have nothing about the selection process to give you. I can tell you about -yes, indeed, she has been extended a little bit, two months, but that's it.
Question: And I wanted to ask you about the readout you gave on Jeffrey Feltman in Sri Lanka.
Associate Spokesperson: Sure.
Question: People in the north that he met with, his interlocutors say they gave him something that they call the ""genocide resolution"" that they wanted him to file within the UN system, and I wanted to know if you could confirm... maybe you can ask him or get... there was no opportunity obviously, and maybe he'll have a press conference here, but if not, could you ask DPA whether he received the document and what he intends to do with it?
Associate Spokesperson: I will. No, nothing else. Perfect. Sorry. Sorry.
Question: Thanks. Also on Mr. Feltman's visit Sri Lanka. Two things. Firstly, it says in his statement that as requested by Sri Lanka, the UN is committed to accountability. Was there discussion with the Sri Lankan authorities about access for the investigation on Sri Lanka that OHCHR is trying to conduct?
Associate Spokesperson: What I have as a readout are his press remarks. I can ask specifically on that, but you saw what he said in his statement about accountability, about Sri Lanka's own promise and commitment to their own investigation. And you remember also what happened in the human -- sorry, OHCHR, the deferral in mid-February if I'm not crazy. Yes, Edie.
Question: Vannina, I'm a little confused because, as I understand it, the Kuwait pledging conference is at the end of March.
Associate Spokesperson: It is on the 31st of March and she's staying beyond that to ensure a smooth transition with her successor -- so that's it. So I think it's a two month extension. I can check for you guys. It's not just a conference. It's also after the conference what will happen and also coordinating that and the pledges that are made and the disbursement of those pledges. It's not just on the 31st of March. Linda, please.  

Question: Thank you [off mic]. Associate Spokesperson: I can't hear you at all without the mic. Question: Sorry. Would you have further information about Staffan de Mistura's latest actions and plans? Associate Spokesperson: Not really. He's continuing his efforts -- engaging with parties. As Stephane told you, I believe, yesterday, he will be in Paris tomorrow, Wednesday, and in London on Thursday. And that's it. Other than that, he is continuing his efforts. Joe? Question: Yes. Is there any plan for the Secretary-General to put out a statement or response to Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech just recently concluded for the joint session of Congress regarding Iran? Associate Spokesperson: No. Matthew. Question: Sure. I wanted to ask about this announcement that was made from this podium about child soldiers in South Sudan that UNICEF had somewhat belatedly announced that there had been this massive, you know, recruitment of child soldiers, and now it's reported that the Government has imposed restriction, movement restrictions on NGOs (non-governmental organizations), and I believe on the UN as well in Upper Nile State, saying they have to give -- get permits to move around. Many people see this as a way of sort of either covering up or making it more difficult to report on these recruitments. Does the UN there have any response to... even if it's only on NGOs to increased restrictions on humanitarian access? Associate Spokesperson: I haven't seen that, but I believe what we told you yesterday was that a team both from UNICEF and the Oversight Mechanism went and did some information gathering. So that effort is certainly there and it will continue both by UNICEF and the Mission in South Sudan. But I'll ask. I haven't seen the reports. Question: Can I ask something about Haiti? Associate Spokesperson: Go. Question: Sure. I wanted to ask, there have been a lot of protests in Haiti about what's either called racism, discrimination, in the Dominican Republic, including the lynching of a Haitian there. Today there's a report that the UN peacekeeping mission is put in charge of the security on the border for a protest that was going to take place in a market in the Dominican Republic. So I wanted to know: is it really the case that MINUSTAH's (United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti) role is to control Haitian protests of what they view as discrimination by the neighbouring country? Associate Spokesperson: That's kind of a weird question -- the way you asked it. I'll ask if MINUSTAH police was deployed anywhere near the border inside Haiti. I will ask that. Yes. Anything else? Perfect. I'll leave you to Ambassador Delattre as soon as he comes. You guys have ten minutes to wait.",Daily Press Briefing By the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General [document],All Africa AFNWS English 
2 March 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"2 March 2015 14:22 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Mar 02, 2015 (The New Times/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- South Sudan women activists have just concluded a strategic meeting in Kigali to set ""priorities for the transitional period"" as the country struggles to find a sustainable solution in the ongoing conflict.
The women's verve and determination to end the conflict ravaging their country is somewhat reminiscent of how Liberian women planned, and unrelentingly agitated to win back peace for their country from debilitating war in 2003.
The power of women should not be underestimated. It will be recalled how women in Rwanda were instrumental in ending the insurgency in the north between 1996 -1999 by telling or persuading their insurgent sons and husbands and other militia to abandon their armed conflict with the government.
They succeeded and continue to be central in conflict resolution and peace-building in their communities across the country.
The South Sudan women had picked on Kigali for the venue of their meeting for its neutrality, but to especially learn from the Rwandan experience.
The women certainly need to be more assertive if the warring male political leadership is to come to an amicable understanding.
In any case, the vicious strife needs to end. Already tens of thousands of people have died in the 14-month conflict, with 1.5 million displaced and 2.5 million now in dire need of food aid.
At the beginning of this month, the warring political leaders signed the seventh ceasefire deal (see Let's push for a lasting ceasefire in South Sudan). The deal did not last a week.
The disappointment of one after another of broken peace deals must serve to firm the women's resolve; which brings me to how the Liberian women won back their country as shown in the now popular video documentary, ""Pray the Devil Back to Hell: Women, War and Peace in Liberia"".
The documentary powerfully demonstrates the power of collective resolve, and tells the moving story of Liberian women who took on the warlords and regime of Charles Taylor in the midst of a brutal civil war, and won a once unimaginable peace for their shattered country in 2003.
The long and short of it is that Charles Taylor is now serving a 50-year sentence for war crimes and crimes against humanity in the United Kingdom. And Liberia is now headed by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the world's first elected black female president and Africa's first elected female head of state.
Without adding much about the women's role in all of this, I will invite you to look out for the documentary. It memorably demonstrates the power women harbour if they should seek to realize a social ideal.
The international community has given President Salva Kiir and his former Vice President, now rebel leader, Riek Machar, a deadline of March 5 to reach a final peace deal that includes a transitional unity government.
A second deadline of April 1 has been set to launch preparations for the transition that should be completed no later than July 9.
The South Sudan women in the Kigali meeting were strategizing for this eventuality, to which the political leaders must be held accountable.
Even as the meeting was going on, the United States was presenting a UN draft resolution to the Security Council on imposing sanctions on the warring leaders.
 

Under the resolution, the Security Council could impose targeted sanctions such as a global travel ban and an assets freeze on individuals who are deemed a threat to the stability of South Sudan. The draft raises the possibility of imposing an arms embargo on the country, a measure strongly backed by European countries. The eight-member eastern Africa bloc, the Inter-governmental Authority on Development (Igad), which is brokering the South Sudan peace deal, is keeping a close watch. But the deal must succeed this time. Otherwise, the South Sudanese women could always borrow a leaf from their Liberian counterparts.

Good afternoon. Happy Thursday! I will start off... I have a statement on Venezuela, and then a few updates on the Secretary-General's travels.
**Venezuela
The Secretary-General is concerned by new reports of violence and loss of life in Venezuela. He has noted the Government's stated willingness to undertake a full investigation.
The Secretary-General has also taken note of the call made on 20 February by the Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) for the building of a democratic space for dialogue in Venezuela.
The Secretary-General supports the current efforts by the Secretary General of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) to re-launch the dialogue between the Government and members of the opposition, initiated in April 2014 and supported by the Union of South American Nations, as well as the Holy See, to help the country overcome its current challenges and guarantee the human rights of all Venezuelans. In this connection, he welcomes the UNASUR Secretary General's announcement of an upcoming visit to Venezuela by a delegation of Foreign Ministers from South America. And that statement is online.
**Secretary-General's Travel
The Secretary-General, as you know, is continuing his official travels to Paraguay today.
Earlier today, he visited the peacekeeping training centre for Paraguayan troops and praised the contribution of the country to UN operations, especially in Haiti. He then flew to Itaipu dam, the second largest in the world, where he encouraged Paraguay to share its positive experience in developing new renewable energy sources.
Yesterday, as you know, we issued a readout of the Secretary-General's meeting with the President of Paraguay [Horacio Manuel Cartes Jara]. He commended Paraguay's progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), especially in the area of poverty reduction.
The rights of indigenous peoples and other human rights issues were also at the heart of their meeting, and later in the day, with representatives of civil society and indigenous groups.
This afternoon, the Secretary-General will address a Special Session of the National Congress of Paraguay -we will issue the text as soon as it's available. And the Secretary-General will then leave for Chile later today, to attend the high-level event organized by the Government of Chile in cooperation with UN Women. And that event takes place on Friday.
**Feltman Travels
Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman continues his visit to Myanmar today. He is leading a UN delegation, which also includes the Secretary-General's Special Adviser Vijay Nambiar, to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-UN Regional Dialogue on Political Security Cooperation.
That two-day event was organized jointly by the UN, Myanmar's Foreign Ministry, as well as Myanmar Institute for Strategic and International Studies.
Mr. Feltman also had a series of bilateral meetings with leaders and senior officials in Nay Pyi Taw, in which he stressed the importance of the national elections, scheduled later this year, being an all-inclusive in order to avoid polarization or exacerbation of communal, ethnic and religious tensions.
 

He also expressed support for the continuation of efforts towards a comprehensive peace process. Following his visit to Myanmar, Mr. Feltman will visit Sri Lanka from Saturday onwards.
There, he plans to meet with senior officials of the Government, political parties and civil society groups in Colombo and Jaffa.
**Kaag
Visiting the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon today, the Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Sigrid Kaag, said that the UN continues to support Lebanon as it faces the impact of the conflict in Syria. She also expressed her appreciation for Lebanon's residents in host communities for their generosity and solidarity with the refugees from Syria.
Her talks with authorities in the Bekaa Valley covered the main political and security developments, as well as the humanitarian and socioeconomic challenges in the Bekaa.
Noting the presence of more than 410,000 refugees from Syria in the area, the Special Coordinator said that the importance of sustained assistance to reinforce the stability and stabilization of Lebanon, benefitting the Syrian refugees and vulnerable Lebanese host communities alike.
And there is more information on her visit online.
**UNESCO Syria
Also in a related note on Syria, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, today launched a two-year programme to help promote access to quality secondary and higher education and teacher training in Syria and neighbouring countries affected by the conflict there.
UNESCO says that evidence shows that the impact of the Syrian crisis on education remains neglected.
And we have that statement available online.
**Gaza
With six months passed since a ceasefire ended the fighting in the Gaza strip, UN agencies and international NGOs today issued a joint statement expressing alarm at the limited progress in rebuilding the lives of those affected and tackling the conflict's root causes.
The statement said that the Israeli-imposed blockade continues, and that the political process, along with the economy, has paralysed living conditions, and also that living conditions have worsened.
Overall, the statement says, the lack of progress has deepened levels of desperation and frustration among the population, more than two thirds of whom are Palestine refugees.
It stresses that we must not fail in Gaza, and that we must realize the vision of making Gaza a liveable place and cornerstone of peace and security in the region.
And in a related note, Japan announced today that is donating $32 million to UNRWA [UN Relief and Works Agency] to support urgent relief and recovery needs in Gaza. And that donation is the largest ever one-time contribution from Japan to UNRWA.
**Security Council
Back here, this morning, the Security Council held consultations on sanctions on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as well as Somalia. Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Herve Ladsous also briefed on the Central African Republic.
And this afternoon, Assistant Secretary-General Kyung-wha Kang and High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres will brief during an opening meeting on the humanitarian situation in Syria. We were told that Mr. Guterres will take your questions at the stakeout after that meeting has concluded.
**South Sudan
Matthew, you asked us about more information on the abduction of children in South Sudan.
And I can say that the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) reports that a joint team from UNMISS and UNHCR visited Wau Shilluk last Friday, following reports about the abduction of children from the area by gunmen in military uniforms.
Witnesses informed the UN team that boys as young as 14 were taken from the town.  

The Mission says it is following up on reports that the abductors allegedly belonged to a pro-Government militia operating in Upper Nile State.
The Mission also says that the Head of the Mission, Ellen Margrethe Loj, met with President Salva Kiir on Wednesday, and she expressed concerns about the reports and urged the President to take action.
**Tobacco
The World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) celebrates its 10th anniversary this week. Known as the single most powerful preventive instrument available to public health, the convention has been one of the fastest endorsed by the UN membership to date, with 180 Parties, covering 90 per cent of the world's population.
And we have more information on WHO website.
**Tipperary
The Secretary-General has been named as the winner of this year's Tipperary International Peace Award. In a letter, he thanks the Tipperary Peace Convention for paying tribute not just to him, but also, through him, to the staff of the United Nations who work with great skill and devotion to serve the world's people.
This is a time of test for the human family, the Secretary-General says, noting that we face the long-standing scourges of poverty and intolerance, as well as newer threats such as climate change and violent extremism.
Despite today's grave challenges, he says that he is convinced that our era offers remarkable opportunities to set the world on course towards a more peaceful, prosperous, equitable and sustainable future for all.
**Honour Roll
And lastly we end with the daily honour roll. Today, we thank Liberia and the Republic of Korea for paying their dues up in full this year to the Regular Budget. Which now makes how many countries paid up in full? 49, excellent, thanks for paying attention.
**Press Conference Tomorrow
Tomorrow at 2 p.m., briefing here by Ambassador Angelo Antonio Toriello, Deputy Permanent Representative of Sao Tome and Principe. He will brief on the forthcoming Ebola Relief Concert which will be held on 2 March in the General Assembly Hall of this very United Nations.
**Questions and Answers
Spokesman: Joe Klein?
Question: Yes. You mentioned Gaza. Can you give us an update on the status of the monitors, whether they are in fact back at their post and how many--
Spokesman: Yes, I do believe... they are back at their post. I think, yesterday we gave you an update on the reconstruction mechanism and number of projects that were online but they are back at their hosts as far as I know. Masood?
Question: Yes, Stephane. Congratulations to the SecretaryaEUR'General for winning that award. On this Gaza thing, in view of the multiple agencies expressing concern on the situation over there, is the SecretaryaEUR'General going to bring this report to the attention of the Security Council and seek more help for the people of Gaza?
Spokesman: Well, I think, A, the statement is one way to bring more attention to the issue and also think in the periodic briefing on the Middle East whether done by Mr. Feltman or the Special Coordinator, those issues are brought to the attention of the Security Council. Nizar?
Question: Yeah, on Yemen, two countries open their embassies in Aden. How does that help with the integrity... preserving the integrity of the State of Yemen?
Spokesman: Obviously, Member States are free to post their embassies wherever they wish. The Security Council yesterday I think expressed its position on the situation in Yemen. Mr. [Jamal] Benomar is continuing his work in order to find a political solution forward. Mr. Lee?
Question: One followaEUR'up, then I'll ask about FDLR. Do you know whether Mr. Benomar... I know he periodically visits Saudi Arabia, visits Doha. I mean... does he... has he expressed a view to them about this shifting and possibly setting up two countries in one?
 

Spokesman: You know, obviously, the aim is to bring a political solution to all of Yemen and that's the focus of Mr. Benomar's work.
Question: Okay. I wanted to ask on this... I guess it's only the Congolese army going after the FDLR. Yesterday you'd said the Mission understood that three FDLR had been captured and the army there earlier in the day had said that three were killed. Many people are saying actually as... as the army gets there, the bases are all empty, i.e., essentially they knew they were coming and went back. Is there... I guess I'm asking both either right this moment or in the days to come, is there a way to be get... to get... it's kind of an important mandate...
Spokesman: I don't disagree...
Question: What's happened?
Spokesman: ... with that. Obviously since the Mission is not supporting this particular operation, I think the information is a little less clear, but as soon as we get something, we'll share it with you.
Question: But just... I guess my request is under their kind of protection of civilians even mandate, seems like they can't... even whether they support it or not...
Spokesman: As I said, I will... I will try to get you as much information as I can.
Question: Okay.
Spokesman: Ms. Lederer?
Question: Thank you, Steph. Two questions: first, on Libya, is there any update on the possibility of talks that Mr. [Bernardino] Leon is trying to organize, and is there any word from Mr. [Staffan] de Mistura on the outcome...
Spokesman: Sure.
Question: ... of his visit to Syria?
Spokesman: No, Mr. de Mistura is not yet in Syria. He's currently in Lebanon. He was just in Turkey. He will be heading to Damascus on Saturday to meet with senior Syrian Government officials to follow up obviously on the cessation of hostilities and to have further consultations. As soon as we know exactly who he's meeting and so on, we'll share that with you. On Libya, unfortunately, no, nothing... nothing to update. Nizar?
Question: Yes. Today ISIS displayed destruction of the Mosul museum or the treasures of Mosul, very old ones from Syrian Sumerian times were destroyed wantonly. I also would like to ask about the museum of Tripoli. It has been tampered with since Tripoli is no longer under protection by anyone.
Spokesman: I have no update on the museum in Tripoli. On what you mentioned in Mosul, I just spoke to our colleagues at UNESCO a few minutes ago. They're taking a look at the video that was displayed online to see exactly what it shows. Obviously, I think the destruction of cultural heritage is a grave crime anywhere. We've seen it in Syria. We've seen it in Afghanistan. By these types of destruction, you rob a country of its future, you rob a country of its culture, of its history, of its heritage.
So we are checking... on your particular question on Mosul, I'm waiting to hear from our colleagues at UNESCO. As I said, I literally just got off the phone with them and they're taking a look at the video.
Question: Since ISIS is already in Tripoli or around Tripoli--
Spokesman: No, I... as I said, I don't have--
Question: Is there anything that can be done to prevent something from happening?
Spokesman: Obviously, again, you know, it shows the wideaEUR'ranging impact of violence in the civil... civil conflict, not only on people, on the education as we said about UNESCO, the impact of the Syrian conflict on the issue of education, but on culture. If there is no State to protect cultural heritage, it places these things at great risk. Yes, in the back.
Question: Did you say that UNESCO is going to release a statement on this?
Spokesman: I said they're taking a look at the video. I do expect them to release a statement. They're analysing the video that is being shown online.
Question: We can expect a statement from them...
 

Spokesman: Yes, and if something comes up in the next minutes, it will be brought to me and then to you.
Question: Thank you.
[The Spokesman later made available the following statement from UNESCO's Director General, Irina Bokova: ""I am deeply shocked by footage released today showing the destruction of statues and other artefacts of the Mosul Museum. I condemn this as a deliberate attack against Iraq's millennial history and culture, and as an inflammatory incitement to violence and hatred,"" said the Director General.
""This attack is far more than a cultural tragedy -- this is also a security issue as it fuels sectarianism, violent extremism and conflict in Iraq. This stands in direct violation to the most recent United Nations Security Council resolution 2199 (2015) that condemns the destruction of cultural heritage and adopts legally binding measures to counter illicit trafficking of antiquities and cultural objects from Iraq and Syria. This is why I have immediately seized the President of the Security Council to ask him to convene an emergency meeting of the Security Council on the protection of Iraq's cultural heritage as an integral element for the country's security.""
Large statues from the UNESCO world Heritage site of Hatra, as well as unique artefacts from the archaeological sites of the governorate of Ninewah have been destroyed or defaced in the Mosul Museum, among many other pieces.
""The systematic destruction of iconic components of Iraq's rich and diverse heritage that we have been witnessing over the past months is intolerable and it must stop immediately"", said the Director-General, reiterating her numerous previous statements on this matter.]
Spokesman: Masood and Mr. Lee.
Question: Yes. On this [inaudible]...
Spokesman: On the what? Sorry.
Question: Did I hear you correctly on this Myanmar visit Mr. Feltman, am I right?
Spokesman: Did you hear me talk about... yes, you heard me correctly.
Question: Okay.
Spokesman: Okay.
Question: My question is, is there going to be... he is going to also be visiting Rakhine area where the Muslims living over there...
Spokesman: I do not believe that he will be. If that...
Question: Okay. Will he release a report when he comes back?
Spokesman: I'm sure there will be some sort of briefing.
Question: Why is he not visiting Rakhine?
Spokesman: The main purpose of his visit is to participate in the joint UNaEUR'ASEAN meeting but obviously, he is also having bilateral meetings with officials. Mr. Lee. Oh, and then...
Question: Thank you for the update on South Sudan, I wanted to ask you another question about that, that some of the... as these talks continue, some of the in opposition, SPLMaEUR'G10 and SPLM in opposition leaders said they will only return to the country if they feel safe. They don't feel safe and SPLMaEUR'Juba has said UN peacekeepers can protect them. So I wanted to know is that within... is that something that UNMISS is offering, to offer, you know, personal protection to in opposition people return...
Spokesman: I don't have any information on that. What I can tell you is obviously the focus should be on the various parties to find a political agreement to allow civilians to go home and to resume their daily lives and be able to feed themselves. Ibrahim?
Question: This question about ISIS, last week about 8,000 [inaudible] in north Iraq ISIS [inaudible] in the library. Do you have any comment about that?
Spokesman: Well, I think it goes to what I've just said... what I've said which is, you know, the destruction of cultural heritage is reprehensible. It's criminal. You rob a country... a society of its past. You rob it of its future. And you destroy its culture. And it's just one of the many horrible acts that we're seeing in these conflict zones.
 

Question: Sorry. FollowaEUR'up on that. Does this apply to the occupied territories, the Palestinian occupied territories where many mosques were being burnt on daily basis? Spokesman: I think you know there was an attack on a mosque yesterday. Mr. [Robert] Serry issued a statement, but I don't particularly agree, I think, with your comparison. Ms. Leopold? Question: Thank you, Steph. I even have the mic on. Do you have any update on Ukraine? Whether the ceasefire's holding? And I'm just curious, is Kyiv responsible to make sure the east gets supplies, water, bank services and so forth? Spokesman: I don't have a particular update on the ceasefire, but as a general answer to your questions, Governments have a responsibility to ensure basic services on their territory. Thank you. Have a great... I was about to say have a great weekend but I may see you tomorrow.",Daily Press Briefing By the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General [document],All Africa AFNWS English 
12 February 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"12 February 2015 12:43 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Feb 12, 2015 (United Nations/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General.
Good afternoon.
**Noon Briefing Guest
In a short while, I will be joined by the Chair of the Advisory Group of Experts on the Review of the Peacebuilding Architecture, Ambassador Gert Rosenthal of Guatemala, who will be my guest.
**Syria
Staffan de Mistura, as you know, just completed two days of discussions in Damascus with the Syrian Government, including a meeting this morning with Syrian President Bashar alaEUR'Assad. In speaking to reporters just after the meeting, Mr. de Mistura said that the focus of the meeting had been on reducing the violence and increasing humanitarian access to all Syrians. He discussed the issue of the United Nations proposal for a freeze in the city of Aleppo.
The Special Envoy added that he will now travel to New York to report back to the Secretary-General and the Security Council. He said he would speak to the Council during a meeting on Syria on 17 February. That is Tuesday, and we have already asked for him to speak to you afterwards, which I'm sure Mr. de Mistura will be happy to do.
**Libya
On Libya, the UNaEUR'facilitated dialogue reconvened today in the Libyan town of Ghadames. The dialogue, as you know, is aimed at ending the country's political and security crisis. The UN Support Mission in the country (UNSMIL) has said that all main Libyan parties are participating in the dialogue. We should have more details on the meeting later today.
**Mediterranean Sea
On a related note, the UN refugee agency today expressed its shock at reports that some 300 people are confirmed missing after rescue attempts by the Italian Coast Guard off the coast of Italy's Lampedusa. Those who are missing or have perished include migrants and refugees, mainly from subaEUR'Saharan African, who had left Libya in four dinghies. More than 110 survivors have landed in Lampedusa, and they confirmed to UNHCR that they had left on Saturday from Libya on rubber dinghies and had been at sea for days, without food and water.
The agency once again expressed its concern about the lack of a strong searchaEUR'andaEUR'rescue operation in the Mediterranean. Europe's Triton operation, which is run by the Frontex European border protection agency, is not focused on searchaEUR'andaEUR'rescue and is not providing the necessary tools to cope with the scale of the crises. Nearly 220,000 people have crossed the Mediterranean in 2014 and this trend is expected to continue, according to UNHCR [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees].
**Central African Republic
From the Central African Republic, the UN [Integrated Stabilization] Mission in the country, MINUSCA, welcomes the release yesterday of the Minister for Youth and Sports, who had been kidnapped almost three weeks ago. The Head of MINUSCA, Babacar Gaye, reiterated his call on all parties, including armed groups, to join immediately the current momentum for national reconciliation and social cohesion for the return of lasting peace in the Central African Republic.
 

And also on the [Central African Republic], the Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, KyungaEUR'wha Kang, today visited Bambari in the [Central African Republic] and met displaced people and representatives of both Muslim and Christian communities there. She praised community leaders for their continued efforts to reach out across sectarian divides and pushed them to empower their leaders to bring about peace through interaEUR'communal dialogue.
Ms. Kang reiterated that aid is delivered on the basis of needs alone, regardless of religious, political or ethnic affiliations. She stressed that humanitarian workers are taking great risks to deliver aid. She warned that in the current worldwide context of multiple crises, the biggest threat to the people of Central African Republic is that this crisis becomes forgotten.
**Western Sahara
A number of you have been asking us a number of times on the status of Christopher Ross, the Personal Envoy of the SecretaryaEUR'General for Western Sahara. I can report that he arrived in Rabat today. Mr. Ross will hold discussions with Morocco and the Frente Polisario and with the neighbouring States during this mission. We will provide more information on the visit as it comes in to us.
**Burundi
From Burundi, the Special Envoy of the SecretaryaEUR'General and Chief of the UN electoral mission in that country called today for reinforced dialogue and trust between all political actors, ahead of the elections planned in three months. Cassam Uteem met this week with heads of political parties, youth groups, civil society, as well as media organizations. He stressed that the situation in Burundi demands constant consultation between the authorities and other parties. His full statement, if you are interested, is in my office.
**Ebola
The Head of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), Helen Clark, is starting today a oneaEUR'week visit in the three countries most affected by the Ebola crisis: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Her visit aims at affirming the UN's continued commitment to addressing the ongoing crisis, and support for the recovery process.
The SecretaryaEUR'General has tasked UNDP with leading the UN system on EbolaaEUR'related recovery. As part of the overall response, recovery programmes are focused on four pillars: economic opportunities and jobs; recovery of the health system; resilient governance for recovery, peace and stability; and risk management to deal with any future outbreaks.
**South Sudan
From South Sudan, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and partners are overseeing the release of another 300 children from an armed group in South Sudan, in Pibor, Jonglei State. The children surrendered their weapons and will spend their first night in an interim care centre where they will be provided with food, water and clothing. They will also have access to health and psychosocial services. This follows the release two weeks ago of 249 children aged between 11 and 17 in the village of Gumuruk.
In the two weeks since their release, 179 children have returned home to their families, while 70 are remaining with UNICEFaEUR'supported interim care centre, as we try to locate their families. UNICEF says that the cost for the release and reintegration of each child is approximately $2,330 for 24 months, and it is appealing for $13 million to fund immediate needs.
**Senior Managers
I have an announcement on senior managers' compact signing: The SecretaryaEUR'General will sign his senior managers' compacts for the year 2015 at a signing ceremony this Friday at 10 a.m. in his conference room. There will be a photoaEUR'op and you will be invited to attend. Senior managers at Headquarters will be physically present, while those away from Headquarters will participate via videoconference.
**Press Conferences
Lastly, tomorrow, at 11 a.m., a briefing here by Carlos Mesa, former President of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. And then at noon, I will be joined by Robert Piper, the Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Sahel, and David Gressly, the Humanitarian Coordinator for Mali. They will brief on the Sahel Humanitarian Strategic Response Plan. Mr. Reuters?
**Questions and Answers
Question: Thanks, Stephane. Mr. UN. The organization Human Rights Watch just released a report a little over an hour ago about the mass rape in Darfur. They criticized the UN or UNAMID [African Union-United  

Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur], specifically, and the UN for not doing its own investigation, suggesting that lack of access, as UNAMID has experienced, was not an excuse not to do investigation. They did theirs remotely. So, I'm just wondering if the UN considers that to be a fair criticism. Is it possible to do a remote investigation and will there be any sort of follow-up on this? They also criticized UNAMID for its initial press release and said that the SecretaryaEUR'General had tried to correct the record. I wonder if you could comment on that.
Spokesman: Sure. I think, in general terms, we welcome the release of this report by Human Rights Watch. I think whether it's the UN or Human Rights Watch, we're all working towards the same goals, which is the protection of human rights in [Darfur]. I think whether it's Human Rights Watch or the UN, people employ different methodologies to go about getting to that goal. And we have different mandates. Obviously, they're an NGO [non-governmental organization], we're not. We operate under different circumstances.
You know, as to your question regarding the specific incident, as you know, we have repeatedly asked to go and to be granted access. That access has not been forthcoming. We need that access in order to conduct a full, an independent investigation of the situation. We would like to have that access as much... as quickly as possible in order to shed light on the very grave allegations of rape... mass rape that took place in the town of Thabit. You know, as for... as I said, in terms of the remote access, I think we're working on... with different methodologies, different groups use different methodologies. I think we feel that it's very important for us to have that direct access. Mr. Lee?
Question: Sure. I guess two things. One, I mean, you didn't answer on the 9 November [2014] press release that was put out by UNAMID and remains online. Is that retracted? I also wanted to ask: the SecretaryaEUR'General is scheduled to meet with Ibrahim Ghandour of the Sudanese Government today at 3:55 p.m. Can we expect him to raise the issue of access to Thabit? And, finally, yesterday a Sudanese diplomat here in New York told me that he had meet with Mr. [Herve] Ladsous earlier this week and described the meeting as very nice. So, I'd like to get a statement, either now or later today, on whether Mr. Ladsous even raised the issue of Thabit or access to Thabit at this ""very nice meeting?""
Spokesman: I hear the description from the Sudanese side of the meeting. We'll see if I can get anything on it. We'll try to get a readout of the meeting this afternoon with the SecretaryaEUR'General with Professor Ghandour. You know, what happened, I mean, I think, as we all know, UNAMID did visit Thabit on the ninth, following the initial allegations of rape. As we said, however, due to a heavy security presence, the result of the fact-finding mission was inconclusive. I mean, I think for us, safe, unhindered access to the town is critical. We need to be able to talk to the victims in a way where they feel safe and they feel unpressured from authorities.
Question: Just one thing. When you say it's inconclusive, the reason I ask this is they put out a press release that remains online that said village leaders coexist peacefully with local military authorities in the area. So, it really wasn't inconclusive. And it seemed like... does that stand? What happens when... does this get approved by DPKO [Department of Peacekeeping Operations] before it went out? What's the status of the document?
Spokesman: I'm speaking from Headquarters on behalf of the SecretaryaEUR'General. I think I've stated our view of the situation. You're always free to call and pick up the phone and talk to UNAMID. Anna?
Correspondent: Thank you, Stephane. I wanted to ask about one of the biggest elephants in the room, about Ukraine. Especially since the negotiations in Minsk have started or are about to start. According to UN official statistics, from 31 January to 5 February, and I'm not going to say ""around"" and then people because these are people we're talking about, 263 people, all of them civilians, were killed. And this is UN official statistics. Just to get the scope of the tragedy, if we take the horrible tragedy in France, more people have died...
Spokesman: We've been reiterating the scope of the tragedy. I would like to hear your question.
Question: France's tragedy multiplied 20 times just for five short days. The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Laurent Fabius, actually said, I'm quoting him, that the negotiations in Minsk are the last effort... last chance to have normal negotiations and peace. So, how does UN view these negotiations? And what kind of results will be desirable and acceptable for the United Nations?
Spokesman: We, obviously, welcome the discussions that are going on in Minsk. I think there are very intense diplomatic discussions going on right now and we don't know what the results will be. We very much hope it will be positive results. It's not up to us to accept or not to accept the results. What we want to see is a cessation of hostilities and an agreement that all parties will abide to. We've seen agreements signed before, but what's important is that people sign and abide by those agreements. And as you have stated, the human toll on this, of this crisis is growing every day. We've seen the last 24 hours, with civilians being killed in and around bus stops. I mean, we've talked about here the fact that there have been, I think, more than 600,000 internally displaced people in Ukraine within the last year when there were zero a year ago. So, the
 

need to find an agreement, to reach an agreement and to uphold an agreement is clear. And we see that need every day when civilians are dying.
Correspondnet: God forbid this doesn't happen.
Spokesman: I promise I will come back to you. Masood, then Sangwon? One second. Go ahead. Then we'll go.
Question: On the ferry disaster and people being killed, now, I'm sure you must have briefed at the top of the briefing. Is the United Nations or UN, I mean, the refugee agency going to do a comprehensive reasoning as to why these refugees have been killed again and again the same area? And they keep on reporting... and they are being rescued by the Italians and so forth. But, there has been no comprehensive analysis as to why this is happening again and again, and people are coming back again and again.
Spokesman: Well, I'm not sure I know how to answer your question. I mean, people are driven, obviously, by all sorts of reasons to put their lives at risk to cross the Mediterranean in search of a better life, in search of reunification with their families. They may be fleeing all sorts of things. We're seeing the conflict go on in Libya, in other parts of Africa. It is driving people to take drastic measures, often in the hands of criminal elements who help with the crossings. It's wintertime. The seas are very rough in the Mediterranean. And their ships are not seaworthy.
Question: Basically, I mean, is the criminal element and the other sinister, I mean, ideas being floated around, it can be done, but this reason or that reason? Is that basically the reason?
Spokesman: Well, I don't know what more I can add, Masood. The reasons for people fleeing and putting their lives at risk in search of a better life are numerous. Obviously, we need to address the root causes of why they're fleeing in order to stop this human tragedy that we see on a scale every day. Yes, sir? And then we'll go to you, Sangwon.
Question: This is Mushfiqul Fazal. I would like to draw your attention to Bangladesh. As you know, Bangladesh is facing very crucial time. People are suffering a lot. And vehicles are burning in the street and the extra-judicial killing crossed the limit. And people are fighting for democracy and their voting rights. And I want to know what exactly [what the] United Nations [is] doing to restore democracy in Bangladesh to build a peaceful Bangladesh and to stability, because the last election was held in 2014, 5 January, and there was a oneaEUR'sided poll, and before the election the Assistant SecretaryaEUR'General Mr. [Oscar] Fernandez-Taranco visited Bangladesh; but after any conclusion, he went back and there was a one-sided poll and 154 seats the Government won without any election. So, I want to know, the United Nations expressed concern... do you think is it sufficient to just express the concern or United Nations should do more to restoring democracy in Bangladesh and to hold free and fair and credible elections? Thank you very much.
Spokesman: Sure. As you rightly put it, the [former] Assistant SecretaryaEUR'General in charge of [Political Affairs] Oscar Fernandez-Taranco has been tasked by the SecretaryaEUR'General to liaise with the Government and he's doing just that. The SecretaryaEUR'General is personally committed to the stability and positive development of Bangladesh. Bangladesh, as you know, is a critical partner of the United Nations in many areas. And obviously, I think, as we've said here a number of times, we are very much concerned about the violence and the loss of life that's occurred in Bangladesh since the beginning of last year. Sangwon?
Question: Thanks, Stephane. Last year, the SecretaryaEUR'General said... this was in April 2014... that ""this moment does not seem very practical to send troops"", referring to the possible UN peacekeeping role in Ukraine. What's the status of his view on that now? Have things changed? Does he support that? And I say this because the Russian ambassador has been talking about the possibility of this.
Spokesman: I think, as you know, the decision to initiate and send troops... UN peacekeeping troops, is up to the Security Council. I don't think I want to go any further at this point, as the talks in Minsk are currently ongoing. Ms. Fasulo and then we'll move to the front.
Question: Thank you, Stephane. Also following up on the Ukraine issue, regarding the civilians that have been killed, does the UN or its partners have a sense of what portion of those civilians have been killed by separatists and what portion by the Ukrainian Government? Secondly, there were reports several weeks ago about the Ukrainian Government withholding or planning to withhold pensions from those living in the pro-separatist areas. And finally, there also were reports that the Ukrainian Government was restricting the travel of those living in the east. I'd welcome any response.
Spokesman: I haven't seen any more updates on those last two issues you've seen. As to who is responsible for the killing of civilians, I think our human rights colleagues have done some preliminary work in a report there on a monthly basis, but it's obviously very difficult to say with any... to have any conclusive conclusions at this point, as we don't have any observers on the ground. You know, at a certain point, what we are really focusing on is just saving lives. I think people are struggling. They are trying to go about their daily lives in the  

middle of an urban war zone. And I think the suffering that we see just in the last 24 hours underscores the need to reach an agreement in Minsk that the parties can live up to. Front row and then we'll go to the back?
Correspondent: Thank you, Stephane. Going to ask a question about Middle East. There are certain questions that are almost forbidden to ask in regard of Middle East. One of them is this one that I think I'm going to ask from you.
Spokesman: I don't think I've ever forbidden a question.
Correspondent: But, answering is another thing.
Spokesman: Well, that's a different issue.
Question: Does UN know who's providing guns and money to IS? And can UN name the names? Just rather than nodding the head.
Spokesman: We don't have any conclusive... we don't have any investigatory capacity to answer that, to answer the question. With the message... the constant message has been from this podium is that all those who are supplying arms should stop doing so and that increasing the flow of arms is probably not the best solution to the crisis. Nisar? Microphone, please. I can't hear your question. Maybe that's a good thing.
Question: There's a very intensive escalation of fighting between Quneitra, Daraa and at the Golan area in Syria. Have you received any reports from the UNDOF [United Nations Disengagement Observer Force] there? And whether that escalation can affect the front at that area?
Spokesman: I don't have an update from UNDOF today. I'll come back to you. All the way in the back? Then Stefano and then Erol. Yes, go ahead.
Question: Thank you. I just want to know: Does the SecretaryaEUR'General have any comment on the concept paper for Security Council open debate on 23 February? Thank you.
Spokesman: Which open debate?
Correspondent: Concept paper for Security Council open debate on 23 February.
Spokesman: I think the SecretaryaEUR'General, as far as I know...
Question: Does he have any comments on this?
Spokesman: He will deliver remarks, if I'm not mistaken. We'll have to wait till he delivers the remarks.
Correspondent: Great, thank you.
Spokesman: Stefano then Erol and then Carla.
Question: A follow-up on what Masood was asking. I, personally, think that, actually, the UN should do more, because UN knows exactly what is going on in the Mediterranean this moment, because we were here in this room, and you and the UN addressed the problem... is that if you have there a programme like there was Mare Nostrum that is there to save lives, you save lives; if you don't have the programme, then a lot more people die. So, we know that Europe change the programme. Now Italy is not doing any Mare Nostrum and Italy is not... the question is this: What the UN can do, for tomorrow... Italy, again, implementing Mare Nostrum, if it's a problem of money to practically, I will not say the word oblige, but at least demand the Europe implement a programme, an effective programme where is there to save lives. Can the UN do that?
Spokesman: Stefano, you walked into the briefing maybe a few minutes later than I, but in what I read out from UNHCR, I think it's pretty clear that UNHCR, the UN's lead on refugee issues, once again expressed its concern about the lack of a strong search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean, said that the Triton operation run by Frontex is not focused enough on search and rescue and is not providing the necessary tools to cope with the scale of the crisis. So, what we do need is better search and rescue assets in the Mediterranean to prevent deaths.
Correspondent: I'm sorry, Stephane, I heard that, because I heard what you said. I'm very happy with what you said. Just saying, what the UN can do to, you know, to make Europe do it. Because you have been saying that for months. You have been saying that for months.
Spokesman: This is an issue that we have raised, whether it's the SecretaryaEUR'General, or the High Commissioner for Refugees... have raised it, all sorts of levels, including the highest levels in Europe. And obviously, we also... the important thing to keep in mind is the issue of burden sharing. As I think you know, Italy, Greece, Malta, among others, are carrying a very heavy burden of these operations, and they need
 

help. Thank you. Let's still go to the first round. Erol then Carla, and then Joe. Joe, raise your hand higher so I can hear you... see you, rather. Go ahead, Erol.
Correspondent: I may also come a little later than you, Mr. Dujarric.
Spokesman: I must be quite late. But, go ahead.
Question: But, still, I would like to ask you this question of the Security Council reform of the General Assembly. In what fashion the UN SecretaryaEUR'General is involved in it, number one? And, number two, does the SecretaryaEUR'General think that something substantial will happen until the end of his mandate on this field?
Spokesman: The SecretaryaEUR'General has often underscored the need for Security Council reform, but I think, as you well know, this is an issue firmly in the hands of Member States. The President of the General Assembly is also taking the lead in this issue as it is a Member State issue. We hope that agreement comes soon, but we're not going to put a time frame on that hope. Mr. Klein?
Question: I want to say what Stefano is saying: What would be the answer of the SecretaryaEUR'General to those who are unhappy with these answers that are all the same?
Spokesman: I don't think I understand your question. Please maybe turn on your microphone. That may help me understand your question.
Question: What would be the answer of the SecretaryaEUR'General to those who are saying that they're unhappy with these kinds of answers on the Security Council reform?
Spokesman: At the risk of continuing a perpetual cycle of unhappy answers, the reform of the Security Council is important. The SecretaryaEUR'General has talked about it for quite some time. But, it is an issue that is firmly in the hands of the Member States. And they are discussing it and they're discussing it intensively. Mr. Klein?
Question: Yes. Concerning the SecretaryaEUR'General's recent visit to Saudi Arabia, just as a couple follow-ups on that: He said he didn't have enough time, I think, in response to a reporter's question, to talk about specific human rights abuses, including the lashing sentence that was partially carried out. He also said in that press conference that he welcomed Saudi Arabia's support of interfaith dialogue. So, my question is, number one, since the SecretaryaEUR'General has spoken out on many occasions about very specific human rights abuses in other countries, why he didn't use that opportunity when he was in Saudi Arabia? And, secondly, what does he mean in terms of praising the dialogue, interfaith dialogue in a country where public worship of any religion other than Islam is prohibited? There's certain places, holy sites that non-Muslims can't even visit in Saudi Arabia, blasphemy laws, apostasy laws, et cetera. What was he trying to say in that context?
Spokesman: He was referring to Saudi Arabia's support for the interfaith dialogue centre that is based in Vienna, in cooperation with other countries. I think if you look at the transcript of his press conference, which, you know, by the way, it was carried live on Saudi television, the SecretaryaEUR'General was very clear in a very public call for Saudi Arabia's commitments... for the need for Saudi Arabia to commit to human rights, including freedom of assembly, freedom of expression and the rights of migrant workers, among others. And I think he did so, he raised it in a very public and direct way. No, one second. Carla?
Question: Does the SecretaryaEUR'General have any comment upon the fact that the US Congress has approved sending lethal aid to the Government of Ukraine? And is there any comment upon the fact... about the fact that Henry Kissinger has said the US committed a fatal mistake getting involved in Ukraine? And Mikhail Gorbachev has said that the US dragged Russia into a cold war that could lead to a hot war?
Spokesman: I think the SecretaryaEUR'General's view on the situation in Ukraine has been clear from the start, is that there is a need for peaceful and political agreement to resolve the outstanding issues and to stop the suffering of the civilians as we see it, as we see it every day. I've answered your question, I think. Mr. Lee?
Question: Follow-up on Bangladesh and also something on the Western Sahara thing you announced. You said that Mr. Taranco is still involved in this issue. I notice that he's meeting this afternoon with Nisha Biswal, the US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia. Is it fair to assume that that's what that meeting is about? And how would you characterize it?
Spokesman: I think it's not fair to assume anything. I'll now see if I can actually get you some facts, as opposed to assumptions.
 

Question: On Mr. Ross' visit, I wanted to know whether he in fact will go to Laayoune, the main city in Western Sahara. Maybe I missed when you read it out.
Spokesman: I will get you... as I said, as we get details, we'll get them to you.
Question: If he's not, can we find out why he's not?
Spokesman: Sure. The lone voice in the back?
Question: I apologize. I only have a question. On the eve of the Council action tomorrow on Yemen and ISIS [Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham], can you tell us what senior UN leadership feels regarding these developments, paying of ransoms, Yemen, what's at stake? I know there have been print statements from the SecretaryaEUR'General. I haven't seen him publicly lately.
Spokesman: You know, obviously, we're all following the situation in Yemen very closely. The SecretaryaEUR'General's Special Adviser on Yemen, Jamal Benomar, is on the ground talking to the parties. We're seeing the security situation deteriorate, which really leads us to redouble our efforts to find a diplomatic solution that would also have to involve the Security Council and the support of the Gulf Cooperation Council. This is an issue the SecretaryaEUR'General has been focusing on personally for quite some time, especially during his recent travels to Saudi Arabia and to the UAE [United Arab Emirates]. Yes, sir?
Question: Thank you. Today is the anniversary of Iranian revolution, and the Mission of Iran is celebrating it here at the UN this afternoon. We are seeing that more people perished because of the human right abuse in Iran after revolution than before revolution. Is UN still pushing the human rights strongly on Iran? Or because of the negotiation right now with nuclear, it's kind of everything gone soft?
Spokesman: I think, on human rights, there have been reports to the General Assembly in Iran, and whether in any country the human rights situation remains up front and we continue to report on them, not just on Iran, but throughout the world. Nisar, then Masood?
Question: Yeah, on the interfaith centre on Vienna, I remember that the Chancellor of Austria asked this question: What is this interfaith doing? Which is sponsored by Saudi Arabia. Another thing, if/when the SecretaryaEUR'General was there, senior called Nimr al-Nimr, who is an Ayatollah, was sentenced to death. And he's been there after he had been shot several times. Was this issue raised, among others?
Spokesman: I am not aware of the particular case. Masood?
Question: How about the interfaith centre?
Spokesman: As I said, when the SecretaryaEUR'General was referring to the issue of Saudi leadership on interfaith dialogue, that's what he was referring to. Masood?
Question: Stephane, do you have any idea when is the United Nations Human Rights Office [is] going to issue a report on the Israel's human rights abuses in the occupied territory?
Spokesman: I think as we said from here, the work on that report is ongoing. Mr. Lee and then we have to go to our guest.
Question: Ask quickly on the Central African Republic and DRC. On the Central African Republic, there are different reports about helicopters used to fire at exaEUR'Seleka. It's unclear from the reports, at least to me, whether these are UN mission helicopters or French forces helicopters. Some say France attacked the rebels, some say the UN did. Who did the firing?
Spokesman: The UN does not have any air capacity in the Central African... you're talking about Central African Republic?
Correspondent: Yes, I am.
Spokesman: Does not have any air capacity in the Central African Republic. These were not UN helicopters.
Question: But, was it a UN operation to attack the exaEUR'Seleka?
Spokesman: There were both UN forces and Sangaris forces who launched a successful operation that expelled exaEUR'Seleka elements from all administrative buildings in Bria. But, the fact that it was reported that it was UN helicopters was an error. On the part of the UN, I must say.
Question: Thanks. I just wanted, I saw these reports that the UN's support to the FARDC's [Congolese Armed Forces] action against the FDLR [Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda] has been ""paused"". And I
 

was wondering what the support actually was, since you... I think you said from here there's yet to be any military action by the Congolese Army. So, what support is being paused? And then Mr. [Martin] Kobler has since tweeted that there is some support to FARDC. So, it's a little unclear. I know you're going to say it's operational. But, it's becoming, there's a lot un-clarity about it. Can you cut through the fog? Spokesman: I don't cut through the fog. That's not my job description. Correspondent: Defog. Spokesman: Sorry. Let's try it again. You know, as we said, in general terms, the support that MINUSCA will provide is broad logistics, operational and strategic support to the FARDC in the operation against the FDLR. As to what actual support had been given prior to the pause, I think you would have to ask the mission. Thank you. I'll come right back.",Daily Press Briefing By the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General [document],All Africa AFNWS English 
9 February 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"9 February 2015 16:44 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Feb 09, 2015 (United Nations/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General.
Good afternoon. Happy Friday.
**Gaza
Starting off with a statement on behalf of both the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the Secretary-General of the League of Arab States, in support of Gaza.
The Secretaries-General of the United Nations and the League of Arab States express their deep concern over the situation in Gaza. They urgently appeal to donors to honour and disburse as soon as possible their financial commitments made at the October 2014 Cairo Conference. This support should also include funding for UN agencies that are carrying out vital operations in Gaza, in order to prevent a further deterioration in the already dire humanitarian situation.
The pace of reconstruction in Gaza remains slow. It is crucial now to expand the scope of reconstruction efforts thus far to bring hope to the people of Gaza and ensure stability, based on international responsibility in reconstruction and lifting the siege.
Both Secretaries-General note the progress made so far under the temporary Gaza reconstruction mechanism, which has to date enabled access to construction material for some 55,000 Gazan homeowners in support of shelter repairs. The operations of the mechanism are ready to be scaled up to facilitate the swift implementation of major large-scale projects.
**Female Genital Mutilation
Today is the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation. In his message, the Secretary-General calls on health workers around the world to eliminate the deeply harmful practice that affects at least 130 million girls and women in 29 countries.
The Secretary-General says that breaking the silence and disproving the myths around female genital mutilation are the first steps along the way to eliminating it altogether. He urges an end to the practice and create the future we want, where every girl can grow up free of violence and discrimination, with full dignity, human rights and equality.
UN agencies like UNICEF and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) also issued messages, calling on all health workers to stop the medicalization of female genital mutilation and mobilize against this dangerous and deeply harmful practice.
**South Sudan
From South Sudan, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Valerie Amos, and actor Forest Whitaker, who is, as you know, a Special Envoy for the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), arrived in Juba this morning on a three-day visit to assess the humanitarian situation in South Sudan and the need for timely funding for the aid operation there.
They met with President Salva Kiir to discuss the humanitarian crisis, and are scheduled to meet with the Humanitarian Country Team later today. In the coming days, they are expected to visit displaced communities in the UN base in Juba and travel to Jonglei State to assess the humanitarian situation on the ground. Ms. Amos emphasized the need for a comprehensive political solution to the crisis.
Also from South Sudan, our colleagues at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warn today that a staggering 2.5 million people -- about one fifth of the population -- remain in either Crisis or Emergency level  

food insecurity as fighting continues. An additional 3.9 million people are in a state of stress regarding their food security, and the food crisis is expected to deepen between April and July, when the lean season reaches its peak. FAO is urgently seeking an additional $32 million to maintain and expand its current operations in South Sudan, as well as to procure supplies for the coming year.
**Security Council
Back here, the Security Council was briefed, as you know, by Farid Zarif, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Kosovo. That was done by videolink from Kosovo in an open meeting. He said that today's meeting took place at a key juncture of Kosovo's history. Last December, after a prolonged political impasse, a new Kosovo government was formed, and it has committed itself to strengthening the rule of law and continued dialogue with Belgrade.
Following that meeting, the Security Council will also meet on the situation in Mali, followed by consultations on Sudan sanctions and other matters. This afternoon, the Council is scheduled to hold consultations on Syria and other matters.
**Ukraine
From Ukraine, our colleagues at the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said today that fighting in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region is forcing more people from their homes, pushing the number of people who have been registered as internally displaced close to 1 million.
In addition, since last February, some 600,000 Ukrainians have sought asylum or other forms of legal stay in neighbouring countries, in particular Russia, but also including Belarus, Moldova, Poland, Hungary and Romania. The agency's teams have reported that heavy fighting in Donetsk over the last two weeks has resulted in massive destruction of buildings and infrastructure, and in the collapse of basic services.
Many people are still trapped by the fighting, including in basements and buildings under constant bombardment. Nearly 3,000 civilians have been evacuated from the towns of Avdiivka, Svitlodar and Debaltseve, which have seen fierce combat. Several incidents of shelling of buses carrying the evacuees have been reported.
**Democratic Republic of the Congo
A couple of human rights notes from our colleagues at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva. They expressed their concern about at least 300 people who remain in detention in the Democratic Republic of the Congo after mass arrests during the recent protests in Kinshasa and in Lubumbashi.
**Burundi
On Burundi, they also said today that they remain very concerned about the continuing detention of Burundian journalist Bob Rugurika, the Director of the independent Radio publique africaine (otherwise known as RPA).
**Ebola
On Ebola, a quick note from UNICEF. They said today that some 16,600 children are registered as having lost one or both parents or their primary caregivers to Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. However, fewer than 3 per cent have had to be placed outside family or community care. UNICEF has been helping to identify children without parents or caregivers to provide them immediate care and protection.
**World Food Programme
In a statement issued today by the Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP), Ertharin Cousin, she paid tribute to Japanese journalist Kenji Goto for the support he had been providing to the World Food Programme in the last years of his life.
Ms. Cousin says that Kenji Goto was an ally in the fight against hunger, covering Syria operations extensively and traveling to refugee camps in Jordan with WFP staff on a regular basis. She added that we are all indebted to Kenji for his genuine interest and support and for telling the people of Japan the story of WFP's work and the people it serves. Her statement is online.
**Serbia
I was just handed in a readout of the Secretary-General's meeting with Ivica DaAiA, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Serbia and Chair-in-Office of the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe).  

They discussed the imminent resumption of the Belgrade-Pristina talks, which the Secretary-General welcomed. They also discussed the conflict in Ukraine in depth, with both agreeing on the urgent need for a ceasefire, the protection of civilians as a foremost concern, and a durable political solution to end the conflict.
The Secretary-General noted that both himself and the Deputy Secretary-General -- who is currently in Munich for the Security Conference -- are continuing to engage with key stakeholders in support of a quick end to violence and a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The Secretary-General also thanked Mr. DaAiA for continued efforts of the OSCE toward this end.
**Appointment
A couple of other notes. Senior appointment today. The Secretary-General is announcing today the appointment of David Gressly of the United States as his Deputy Special Representative for Operations and the Rule of Law in the UN Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, known by its French acronym as MONUSCO. Mr. Gressly succeeds Abdallah Wafy of Niger, who had served in that post since 2013, and as Police Commissioner and Head of the Mission's police component before that from 2010 to 2013. The Secretary-General is grateful for Mr. Wafy's dedicated service during those past five years.
**Honour Roll
Sadly, no Member State can be credited today for paying its dues in full and on time, but we hope that they are just taking Friday off and on Monday we can resume listing their names.
**Press Conferences
In just a few minutes, we will have Jean-Victor [Nkolo], who will brief you on behalf of the President of the General Assembly.
On Monday, Ivan SimonoviA will be here as our guest to brief you on his recent trip to South Sudan.
Nizar?
**Questions and Answers
Question: Yeah. On Yemen, of course, a short while ago, there were announcements of the presidential developments, then unconstitutional ones, that changes in Yemen. Have you had time to look into that, and do you have any view about it?
Spokesman: No, I think this power vacuum is of great concern to us. The SecretaryaEUR'General and all those who are concerned with Yemen here are following the situation very closely. We're trying to get an update from Mr. [Jamal] Benomar for you as soon as we can. So obviously, these developments are ongoing. But we'll try to get you an update as much as we can.
Question: Is Mr. Benomar holding any talks in Riyadh regarding that?
Spokesman: No, as I said, we're trying to get you his discussions. We understand he's on his way back to Sana'a right now. Please, I'll come back to you. Senora? And then we'll go to Matthew.
Question: Hi, Stephane. Is the SecretaryaEUR'General have any comments on the death -- death of the American worker, humanitarian worker in -- by the air strike in -- by Jordan?
Spokesman: I have not seen anything on that. Obviously, if that were the case, we would extend our condolences to her and her family. But we will look into it. Matthew?
Question: Sure. Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the -- a senior -- a selfaEUR'described senior UN official had said they have laid down an ultimatum as to two generals that are leading the Congolese stated fight against the FDLR [Forces democratiques de liberation du Rwanda]. And today Lambert Mende, spokesman of the Government, has said that they reject these ultimatums and so I wanted to know, the way it's described is that the UN -- I've been asking you here, but obviously something was said elsewhere in the building to some that the ultimatum is until 13 February or they would forfeit MONUSCO's support to the operation. So I wanted -- I don't think it's an operational detail. I want to know: Has the UN been providing support to units of the FARDC [Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo] engaged with the FDLR? Which units are those? And would it, in fact -- will it now, given this statement, be suspended?
Spokesman: A couple of things. First of all, my understanding from here is that the FARDC operations have not commenced in terms of the military operations. The discussions regarding the human rights issues that we've raised about the two generals are ongoing and they're ongoing in Kinshasa.
 

Question: Right. But can you react -- the spokesman for the Government has said we will only replace them if there is...
Spokesman: Well, I did hear your question. My reaction is that the discussions are ongoing in Kinshasa.
Question: One last thing because I've seen there have been various statements about the actions have already started. ""We welcome the action."" ""We are fleeing the action."" Do you know... [overlapping talking]
Spokesman: I'm just saying, my understanding is the military actual fighting has not, as far as we know, has not commenced. The operation is under way. But obviously, we understand that the actual -- there's been no actual fighting reported as of yet.
Question: Why can't we get DPKO (Department of Peacekeeping Operations) on the record to speak about this matter?
Spokesman: Well, I think as I said this is a -- this operation is being led from -- our support for the operation is being led from the field, and I think the questions will be answered there.
Question: Was a senior official here in the building or--
Spokesman: You know what? The one thing we do have a lot of here are senior UN officials. Thank you. Yes, sir?
Question: On the record, the President's microphone is totally broken. But anyhow, Stephane, I wanted to ask you, there is an official letter sent by group of citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, calling themselves the -calling themselves citizens consuls from Sarajevo to SecretaryaEUR'General Ban KiaEUR'moon. In that letter, they are advising SecretaryaEUR'General about the difficult situation in Bosnia, especially in regard to the recent crackdown of the media and media freedoms and other freedoms. Does the SecretaryaEUR'General have anything to say about this?
Spokesman: I have not seen -- I have not seen that letter, so we will look into it. Obviously, I think the SecretaryaEUR'General's oftaEUR'stated support for freedom of the press and expression remains the same. Sherwin?
Question: Are you able to flesh out in more detail what's been received in terms of the 5.4 billion pledged in Cairo in relation to the--
Spokesman: No, the actual accounting of the money is being handled by the World Bank, the Palestinian Authority and Norway. So they will have the actual breakdown. What we do know is that not enough of the pledges have been converted to hard cash. We've also seen the situation in Gaza deteriorate over the last few weeks in terms of humanitarian issues. We've seen the demonstrations in front of the UN, both in front of UNSCO (United Nations Special Coordinator's Office) and UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees) which are, you know, a sign of the growing frustration at the lack of quickness of the reconstruction mechanism.
Question: Do you not have a percentage of what's been...
Spokesman: I don't have one off the top of my head. Again these things will be handled by the World Bank, but we'll try to get you one. Abdel Hamid and then we'll move to the eastern front.
Question: I have a few questions about Robert Serry. Where is he? Is he leaving the United Nations altogether--
Spokesman: No, Mr. Serry is still very much in his post.
Question: And when is [Nickolay] Mladenov going to take his place?
Spokesman: As soon as we have a hard date for the handaEUR'over, we will get you one. Obviously, the aim is to have a seamless transition. We hope that there is no gap, but obviously, if there is, there is an acting -there's a number two; James Rawley, who is there.
Question: So I want -- also if you have any update on the visit of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to Washington. Is he meeting any officials, like the President or Vice-President?
Spokesman: I do not believe he's meeting the President of the United States. I know he's had a meeting with Susan Rice or he's having a meeting with Susan Rice, the National Security Adviser, and I think he's having meetings -- I know he's having meetings -- congress -- meetings on the Hill with congressional leaders. But our colleagues at OHCHR (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights) here can give you a full readout. I think he gave an extensive press conference today, as well.  

Question: Just the last thing, it's about Yemen, to follow up what Nizar said. They just issued what they called ""decree of 6 February 2015"". It's really a major development. All we need to know if Benomar was involved, he knows about it--
Spokesman: You know, you are all -- you have a leg up on me, as I don't have a live Twitter feed from my desk, my podium here. As I mentioned, we're obviously very concerned about what's happened in Yemen today, about the power vacuum. Mr. Benomar was in Riyadh. He's now on his way back to Sana'a. We'll have an update as soon as we can. Olga? Sorry. And then we'll go to Nick.
Question: Thank you, Stephane. There are talks ongoing in Moscow...
Spokesman: Sorry?
Question: There are talks ongoing in Moscow between [Vladimir] Putin, [Petro] Poroschenko and [Angela] Merkel on crisis in eastern Ukraine--
Spokesman: Putin and [Francois] Hollande.
Question: Sorry. Because yesterday, there were talks between Poroshenko and John Kerry. So what's the expectations and the assessment of these talks?
Spokesman: Well, I think it's a little early to assess these talks, which are ongoing right now. I think President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel just arrived. We obviously -- we would support any political dialogue, any dialogue that would lead to a political solution to what is going on in the Ukraine. I mean, I think you look at what's just happened over the last year, where we're about to hit the million mark on displaced -- internally displaced people, from what I've just said, and the number of people who have been -- who've had to resort leaving their country. We have a manaEUR'made humanitarian crisis unfolding in front of our very eyes in the past year. So I think that just underscores the importance of a political agreement. Let's go to the back bench and then we'll come back.
Question: Stephane, can I ask you about Syria and the plans to broker these local freezes? There's been a lot of talk about stalemate, the freeze being frozen. I just wonder whether you could give us a sense of if there has been any progress.
Spokesman: I think this is obviously something that Mr. [Staffan] de Mistura is continuing to work on. It's proved very challenging. But I think Syria in the last four years has proven to be extremely challenging in terms of finding a diplomatic and a political solution. The aim of the freeze is really just to start to get a foothold on a cessation of hostilities in one location. And Mr. de Mistura's efforts are continuing. Oleg and then Zach?
Question: Angela Merkel, she's going to be in Washington in the next days. Is she planning to stop in New York?
Spokesman: I don't have any information on her coming here, but maybe our colleagues at the German Mission would know before I do. Zach?
Question: Has any more money come in to Gaza through UNRWA since the suspension of the cash assistance programme, firstly? And secondly, I understand that Mr. Serry's office was attacked once the assistance programme was suspended. Is there a link between the attack... ?
Spokesman: No, I don't -- if I'm correct, I think -- first of all, the programme wasn't really suspended. We temporarily removed a number of people who were working at the crossings into Gaza. Some of the material was aEUR' some of the projects were suspended from various UN agencies for lack of funds, and I think that led to the upsurge of frustrations, understandable frustrations from Gazans, and there was an attack on the UNSCO office, I believe, last week. But I think things have now returned -- calmed down to a certain extent, in terms of those offices. Iftikhar, you've been very patient. And then Go.
Question: My question was on Gaza, was already asked. But I will ask about [President Barack] Obama's speech yesterday at Nashville prayer breakfast, in which he said that there was a connection between press freedom and religious freedom. Does the SecretaryaEUR'General have any comment on that?
Spokesman: We've talked already here about the issue of freedom of expression. I think the SecretaryaEUR'General's commitment to freedom of expression is strong, and he's strongly defended it publicly and privately in meetings with various officials. But what the SecretaryaEUR'General has also called for is an increased tolerance and respect for people's beliefs or for people's nonbeliefs. I think that's also -- it's a very important point to stress. Go?
 

Question: Thank you, Stephane. Could you give us your comment on that Jordanian intensified air strike against ISIS which, as you know, as it was mentioned, according to ISIS, killed even the American hostage?
Spokesman: You know, I think the SecretaryaEUR'General's point has been that the fight against terror and against ISIS in particular needs to be done within the confines of international law, international humanitarian law, and the issue of the protection of civilians is one that needs to be kept in the forefront of any action. Obviously, I think your colleague raised the issue of the American worker. I have -- we have to check those reports and see what we can say. Ann?
Question: Yes. Regarding Ukraine, it has been reported in ""The Wall Street Journal"" today that behind the scenes, Russia has quietly asked Paris and Berlin for more territory in Ukraine and autonomy for the RussianaEUR'backed rebels. The proposal was rejected. Despite several statements by the SecretaryaEUR'General, the talks in Moscow and remarks by the Ukrainian Prime Minister saying he would not agree to any deal that undermines the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, is there any peaceful way out of this conflict?
Spokesman: The peaceful way out of this conflict is to find a political solution, and that's why we're encouraging the parties directly to talk. That has been the SecretaryaEUR'General's point from the beginning. And also for those who have an influence to bear to make sure that influence is positive and the UN's position on the territorial integrity, which you raised, is guided by the relevant General Assembly resolution. Matthew, Nizar, Abdel Hamid, we'll go round two.
Question: Sure. You said about the SecretaryaEUR'General and freedom of expression. So I wanted to ask you, on this upcoming trip beginning today to Saudi Arabia, is the situation of the blogger, Raif Badawi, who's been in prison and scheduled to be flogged, is that something that the SecretaryaEUR'General intends to bring up? I wanted to ask because I saw the announcement was made in a way where it was sort of, things then went off the record. It seems you were there; I saw what was put out by your office. Was this answered in that context? If so, was that asked even in that context? And finally, who's paying for the travel on this trip? Is he flying commercial, paid by the UN? Or is he...
Spokesman: He's flying commercial, paid by the United Nations. The issue of freedom of the press is something the SecretaryaEUR'General routinely raises, and I think we will give you a readout of the meeting with His Majesty after it happens and the SecretaryaEUR'General also has a press encounter scheduled following his encounter with the King, and those remarks will be made public. But you know, the issue of freedom of expression and freedom of the press is raised in many different contexts and many different countries. Nizar, Abdel Hamid?
Question: Yesterday, the armed groups in east Ghouta in Damascus bombarded the centre of Damascus and killed several people. There was no statement about that. Another thing: although the focus is on ISIS everywhere and Da'esh, [Jabhat] al-Nusra has been forgotten totally almost, forgotten whereas there are consolidating their positions in the Golan, with the help of many countries in the region. How does the United Nations view such amassment of forces of troops in a very sensitive area like the Golan?
Spokesman: I don't think any of us have forgotten the most important part of this conflict, which is the toll on civilians, the death toll, the civilians that are being killed, whether they're being killed by ISIS, alaEUR'Nusra, by barrel bombs from their Government, as the SecretaryaEUR'General just reiterated in his latest report to the Security Council, so I don't think anybody's forgotten the victims. I think we keep talking about the victims here and highlighting their plight on a regular basis.
The SecretaryaEUR'General has expressed his concern, his continued concern, over the activities of armed groups, the activities of Government, and in terms of the Golan, you know, the violations that we've seen in the -- of the Disengagement Agreement.
Question: But such -- I mean, such an amassment of forces in the Golan, thousands of alaEUR'Nusra supporters are there with their weapons, including tanks and vehicles--
Spokesman: We're dealing with a very volatile situation in Syria and, notably, in the Golan Heights, and we would appeal for all those who can to do whatever they can to deescalate that situation. Abdel Hamid?
Question: Thank you, Stephane. Again, I want to bring the issue of Palestinian children under occupation and I have a case in particular, if there is any comment. A young girl called Malaka Khatib was arrested on 31 December. She was brought to the court on 21 January. Both -- chained by hands and legs and she was sentenced to $1,500 in fine and three months in jail. She was 14. And that brings the bigger issue. In the year 2014, 1,266 children were arrested. UNICEF said an average of two children a day. And yet these things pass without seeing some statement or strong statement from the SecretaryaEUR'General.
Spokesman: I think -- Abdel Hamid, I think we've talked regularly either from here or other parts of the UN on the plight of children in Gaza and elsewhere. I'm not familiar with the specific case you mentioned, but I think  

there are laws that reflect how children are to be treated in detention or in criminal cases, and every country has the obligation to abide by the Conventions they've signed on to. But I'm happy to look into the case you raised. Mr. Lee and then we'll turn it over to JeanaEUR'Victor, who is jumping out of his seat to talk to you. Question: Sure. I wanted to ask you about Burundi. I saw the statement about the High Commissioner of Human Rights about Bob Rugurika. I wanted to know, there also have been statements about various countries about killings by the Government of Burundi in a place called Cibitoke where some people came across from the DRC, apparently an attack, but they were stopped and then executed summarily. I wanted to know if that's anything MONUSCO or this MENUB (United Nations Electoral Observation Mission) in Burundi can speak to. And also has the Government signed its agreement with MENUB, as had been projected? Spokesman: We will get you an update and I will look into that situation you mentioned. [The Spokesman said later that the agreement had been signed on 21 January.] Oleg, you get the absolute last word. Question: Thank you, Stephane. Is there any reaction to what's happening in Debaltseve right now? Ban KiaEUR'moon was pushing for ceasefire over there. Obviously, it is not holding on. Parties are shooting each other. What's the reaction to this? Spokesman: Obviously, continued concern and disappointment that civilians continue to pay the price for the lack of political agreement. I mean, we've seen schools, hospitals, public transportation targeted, and civilians pay the price. And this just increases the pressure and the need to find a political agreement. Question: Are there any new talks planned? Spokesman: Not that I'm aware of. Thank you. Have great weekend.",Daily Press Briefing By the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General [document],All Africa AFNWS English

Ambassador David Pressman, Alternate Representative to the UN for Special Political Affairs
Remarks at a Security Council Open Debate on the Protection of Civilians
Thank you, Mr. President, for chairing this important meeting. And let me also express my thanks to Assistant Secretary-General Kang, Ms. Durham of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and Ms. Elman of the NGO Working Group on Women, Peace and Security for your informative and moving briefings and your tireless work on this important subject.
Shortly after the Secretary-General released his report on Women, Peace, and Security last year, ISIS released a document of its own: a pamphlet of rules about how jihadists should handle trafficked women and girls, including those sold into sexual slavery.
In recent weeks, the al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front released a video that appears to depict a woman, arms seemingly bound behind her back, kneeling while a man declares that she has been convicted of adultery by an Islamic court.
The video then shows this woman being summarily shot in the head by a man who, himself, is clad in body armor.
Last year, ISIL released its own video that appears to depict a young woman being stoned to death in the presence of her father.
In the final moments of the video, she is seen begging her father for forgiveness. She is then led to a hole dug in the earth, surrounded by men who throw stones at her. The young woman, in what would be some of her final words, offers this advice to women: ""protect your honor more than your lives.""
""Protect your honor more than your lives.""
The unique horror confronted by women and girls in conflict is as chilling as it is urgent. While conflict does not discriminate on the basis of gender, it does disproportionately affect those who are marginalized, vulnerable, or oppressed.
And in too many societies around the world, for too long, women and girls have been marginalized, vulnerable, or oppressed. If we care about addressing the problems encountered by women and girls in wartime, we must be prepared to address the enduring problems of discrimination and inequality of women in peacetime.
As the Secretary-General documented in his 2014 report on Women, Peace and Security, the threats facing women and children in conflict are worsening, not improving, in many parts of the world. We can and we must work together to turn this tide.
Defenders of women's human rights are increasingly targeted. Efforts to silence people like Razan Zeitouneh in Syria and Salwa Bugaighis in Libya are efforts to silence hope, curtail progress, impede justice, and infringe upon the dignity of women not just in Syria and in Libya, but around the world.
 

We know that refugees and displaced persons are mostly women and children. And we know that they suffer disproportionately from sexual and gender-based violence.
In eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, the continued presence of armed groups amid an increasing number of displaced persons and refugee has led to shocking cruelty and rampant sexual violence.
In one of the most devastating incidents, at least 387 people - including 300 women and 55 girls - were raped by armed groups in 13 villages in Eastern Congo between July 30th and August 2nd, 2010. 387 rape victims in three days.
In the face of this kind of destabilizing cruelty and grotesque violence, this Council has mandated peacekeeping missions in places like the DRC with the very difficult and very important work of protecting civilians. Indeed, 98% of UN troops now serve in missions with mandates to protect civilians.
Yet, again and again, there is a gap between what we say must happen and what actually does. We have seen peacekeeping missions fail to implement their mandates to protect civilians, creating a substantial gap between principle and practice, between mandates and implementation.
The United Nations' Office of Internal Oversight Services report found that in 507 attacks against civilians from 2010 to 2013, UN peacekeepers virtually never used force to protect civilians under attack. Thousands of civilians, countless women and children among them, may have lost their lives as a result.
UN peacekeeping missions must do better when they are given a mandate to protect civilians in desperate need of protection. And that means, we must, at a minimum, work to improve early warning systems, especially for sexual violence, to help peacekeepers identify potential threats and take preventative action.
Continued shortfalls staffing critical peacekeeping missions in South Sudan, Mali and the Central African Republic have left civilians, and particularly women and girls, vulnerable.
And when peacekeepers themselves become a part of the problem of sexual and gender-based violence, rather than a solution to it, it is our fundamental responsibility - indeed, it is a moral imperative - that we collectively ensure they are held accountable in a transparent and swift manner.
The Security Council also must do more. It is easy enough for us to agree in an open debate in this Chamber that protecting women and girls in conflict is important - I mean, can anyone really disagree? But when called upon to act, too often we are too slow or too silent.
When reports emerge of an alleged mass-rape in Darfur and active obstruction by the host government of the peacekeeping mission's ability to investigate becomes clear, this Council has an obligation to act. And yet, too often we do not. This must change, as our credibility depends on it, victims need it, and justice demands it.
We are making modest progress and there have been some developments in our collective efforts. Of nine United Nations peacekeeping operations cited in the latest Secretary-General report, nearly 70% of their military strategic concepts of operations include specific measures to protect the human rights of women and girls.
More and more missions are providing more robust gender and conflict analysis in their reporting, but much remains to be done to link analysis and reporting to actionable recommendations, and actionable recommendations to actual action.
Largely due to the work of organizations like those present today, consideration for the risks confronted by women and girls face are now being integrated into peace agreements.
In 2013, more than half of all peace agreements signed included references to women, peace and security. The number of cease-fire agreements that include sexual violence as a prohibited act has tripled compared to only three agreements with such provisions signed prior to 2012.
Here, too, at the United Nations, there is work to be done. Women should not only be participating in peacekeeping operations, they should be leading them.
While three women lead peace operations as SRSGs - one as force commander and one as an acting head women head only 19% of all UN field missions.
And while we welcome the deployment of three all-female UN police units in Liberia, Haiti, and the DRC, we recognize that 97% of military troops and 90% of police personnel in UN missions are men. If we are serious about expanding opportunity for women everywhere, we must expand opportunity for women right here.
 

Expanding opportunity and empowering women in peacetime is essential to tackling the unique problems women confront in wartime. After all, the best protection from sexual violence in conflict that targets women and girls is building societies where women and girls are respected; have equal access to justice, educational opportunities and health care services; societies where women enjoy equal protection under the law and equal access to political space. The best protection, to borrow the final words of the woman slaughtered in ISIL's gruesome video, is the difficult and imperative work of building societies that value women's lives and minds and potential as much as their honor.

30 January 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"30 January 2015 17:38 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Monrovia, Jan 30, 2015 (FrontPageAfrica/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Representative George Mulbah (NPP-District#3 Bong County) has called for reconciliation amongst lawmakers in the wake of ongoing debate and bitter exchanges among members of the House of Representatives about the leadership. Rep. Mulbah in an interview with FrontPage Africa said it is not good for lawmakers who should be working collectively in the interest of the Liberian people, to be at war with each other based on personal interests. Said Mulbah: ""We have to work around to have this matter resolved in the best interest of the Liberian people. Over the past years we have worked as legislators of this country and have taken it from a failed state to one that is now counted among nations of the world in terms of governance."" The Bong County Lawmaker said that tension in the legislature could mean tension in the nation because they are direct representatives of the Liberian people. ""We need to now follow the path of reconciliation and leave behind us all these accusations,"" he said. He warned his colleagues that if such attitudes continue among lawmakers, it could one day agitate the people of Liberia. This he said could lead them to taking actions that are not in the best interest of the nation. Representative Mulbah who is serving his second term as a lawmaker for the people of Bong County was responding to questions as to whether investigation into the US$1.2 million should be brushed aside as part of the reconciliation process. He claimed that the legislature has asked other public institution to be accountable to the Liberian people on funds they received to implement projects, but questioned why there is tension brewing when lawmakers are asked to give account for public funds. The House of Representatives has over the past weeks witnessed tension as some members wrote plenary asking the speaker of the House of Representatives Alex Tyler to recuse himself from presiding over session to faced investigation into a US$25K.",Legislative Cease Fire - Rep.

27 January 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"27 January 2015 15:14 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Jan 27, 2015 (Institute for Security Studies/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- As African leaders meet this week for their bi-annual African Union (AU) summit in Addis Ababa, the world will be watching to see whether the continent is united and pro-active in solving its own problems.
The question is whether leaders can find common ground on strategies to fight terror groups like Boko Haram and to deal with the implosion of Libya.
Will the AU be willing take the unpopular step of imposing sanctions on South Sudan's belligerents? And will countries like South Africa and Tanzania carry out their threats to attack the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo?
These issues will be hotly debated during some of the plenary sessions at the AU headquarters' impressive conference hall - but also in smaller meetings and in the corridors.
Disunity and a lack of coordination amongst the AU's 54 member states have plagued the organisation in recent months, despite efforts of the AU Commission to intervene and initiate mediation on several fronts.
Its recent success in imposing a civilian government in Burkina Faso following a military take-over has been seen as a good example of what can be done if the AU, regional organisations like the Economic Community of West African States, and the United Nations (UN) work together.
Disunity and a lack of coordination have plagued the AU in recent months
Clearly, the AU Commission can't do much without buy-in from African leaders. Many countries are still reluctant to ratify the instruments drawn up by the AU to further democracy on the continent. One example is the AU's 2007 Charter on Elections, which still only has 23 ratifications.
The Commission can't do much to impose free and fair elections if the countries do not agree on the rules of the game. And with no fewer than 11 presidential elections this year, this should be a huge issue for the continent.
All eyes, though, are likely to be focused on how the continent's leaders will deal with the increasing threat of Boko Haram. The Nigerian terror group has made world headlines as they intensified their campaigns in northeast Nigeria and in neighbouring countries.
After threatening Cameroon's President Paul Biya with reprisals if he attacked the group's fighters, Boko Haram spokesperson Abubakar Shekau also launched a tirade in a new video against Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou (whom he wrongly named Muhammed Yusuf).
Niger organised a high-level meeting on Boko Haram in the capital Niamey last week, which was attended by Smail Chergui, the AU Commissioner for Peace and Security. Nigeria only sent an ambassador to the meeting.
'Unless and until Nigeria is at the centre of this process and is leading these regional initiatives, there is no way that the region can move forward [in the fight against Boko Haram],' says Solomon Dersso, Head of the Institute for Security Studies' (ISS) Peace and Security Council (PSC) programme in Addis Ababa.
'The continental response is plagued by mistrust and lack of coordination, and no progress is expected to be made before Nigeria's elections are concluded' he says. Chad's President Idriss Deby, who is firmly establishing himself as the leader of the most pro-active military force in the region, has sent 2 000 troops to Cameroon to fight against Boko Haram.
Many countries have still not ratified AU instruments to further democracy on the continent  

Whether Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan will turn up at the AU summit is not yet clear. The hotly contested presidential elections in Nigeria, which will take place on 14 February, might just keep him away from the Assembly Meeting on 30 and 31 January.
Jonathan, however, has been a regular feature at AU summits since being elected in May 2011, and the absence of the leader of one of Africa's heavyweights will be missed if he doesn't turn up.
Dersso says that although the summit will add impetus to the continental effort of forming a unified regional response against the group, it will only be after the elections that Nigeria will engage meaningfully, and any serious progress would be made in effectively implementing the continental response.
Another notable figure at the bi-annual AU gatherings is another man sporting a hat: South Sudan's President Salva Kiir. Kiir was warmly welcomed into the club of African leaders after South Sudan gained independence in 2011. However, a few years down the line, his country is engulfed by civil war, at a huge cost to the country and its neighbours.
The long-term cost of war and the impact on human development is difficult to quantify. Where would South Sudan have been if all the millions of dollars that poured in from the international community had been put to good use to build the fledgling country?
In a new report, three non-governmental organisations estimate the cost of war in South Sudan could be as high as US$28 billion in the next five years. That is even if Kiir and former vice-president Riek Machar sign a peace deal, and stick to it, in the next couple of months.
The Ugandan-based Centre for Conflict Resolution, the Centre for Peace and Development Studies at Juba University and risk-analysis consultancy Frontier Economics have called on the AU to use this week's summit as an opportunity get the stakeholders in the crisis to move towards resolving the conflict.
How will the continent's leaders deal with the increasing threat of Boko Haram?
The organisations are asking the AU to make public a report on human rights abuses in South Sudan that was drawn up by a team led by former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo.
The contents of the report might not sit well with either of those now being cajoled to the negotiating table. The 15-member AU PSC will meet on 29 January, when the report is expected to be tabled.
The PSC has in past threatened to impose punitive sanctions on both sides if they don't abide by the Cessation of Hostilities agreement, which was signed early last year. Yet it hasn't done so, despite the looming threat of famine and nearly 500 000 refugees who have fled to Sudan, Uganda, Ethiopia and Kenya.
Having complained bitterly at being sidelined during the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) campaign to oust Muammar Gaddafi, the AU has probably got used to not seeing Gaddafi dominate AU meetings with his flamboyant costumes and female guards.
In his place, however, the continent now sits with the spill-over effects of the near disintegration of Libya. The international contact group on Libya, initiated by the AU, will meet at the summit.
The ISS's Dersso, however, says that the deep divisions between international partners like the AU, the European Union and the UN on the issue of Libya will make it very difficult to find common ground towards a solution.
'The policy divisions seem to be very serious, partly thanks to the legacy of the NATO intervention which has affected the various actors very deeply.'
Besides the potentially divisive security matters, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, AU Commission Chairperson, is likely to find consensus on long-term development issues that she has been championing since her election in 2012.
The main theme of the summit is 'women's empowerment and the development towards Agenda 2063'. There will be a dedicated session on this theme, and 2015 is expected to be declared 'the year of women's empowerment'.
On 29 January, the day before the Assembly meets, the heads of states of the 36 member countries of the African Peer Review Mechanism are also expected to meet, under the chairpersonship of Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.
The 20 member states that form part of the New Partnership for Africa Development (Nepad) coordination unit, lead by Senegal's President Macky Sall, will also meet on the same day.
 

Special guests at the summit are Dr Nabil el-Arabi, Secretary-General of the Arab League and Mahmoud Abbas, President of Palestine, who will speak to African leaders during the closing session on 31 January.

23 January 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"23 January 2015 17:02 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Jan 23, 2015 (United Nations/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General.
Good morning.
**Yemen
I will start off with a statement on the situation in Yemen. The Secretary-General is gravely concerned about the deteriorating situation in Yemen. He deplores the heavy fighting between Ansarallah armed groups and Yemeni presidential guards throughout Sana'a.
The Secretary-General calls on all sides to immediately cease all hostilities, exercise maximum restraint, and take the necessary steps to restore full authority to the legitimate government institutions. All sides must abide by their stated commitments to resolve differences through peaceful means and ensure the full implementation of the Peace and National Partnership Agreement in accordance with the outcome of the National Dialogue Conference and the GCC Initiative and Implementation Mechanism. He also reminds all sides of their obligations under relevant Security Council resolutions.
The Secretary-General condemns the kidnapping on 17 January of Dr. Ahmed Awadh bin Mubarak, Director of the Office of the President of the Republic of Yemen. He calls for his immediate release. The Secretary-General urges all sides to remain fully engaged with his Special Adviser on Yemen so as to enable him to continue to exercise the Secretary-General's good offices in close cooperation with the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the United Nations Security Council. Also on Yemen, the Security Council received a briefing on the situation in Yemen this morning by videoconference from the Secretary-General's Special Adviser, Jamal Benomar.
**Ebola
And on Ebola, the Secretary-General spoke at the General Assembly this morning and discussed recent progress in the fight against the spread of Ebola. He said that strong national leadership combined with local community engagement and international support is slowing the incidence of new cases in many places. Liberia, once the worst affected country, has seen the most dramatic improvements.
The Secretary-General said that the outbreak has taught us that there is no room for complacency. We have also learned that our response must evolve to match the increasingly dispersed pattern of the outbreak. And he made a special appeal today to national stakeholders, community leaders, response partners and Member States: Stay engaged and sustain this effort. The Secretary-General said it is crucial to ensure that there are sufficient resources to eliminate the disease and ensure recovery. His full remarks are in my office.
Also briefing the General Assembly was Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, the Head of the UN Emergency Ebola Response Mission, UNMEER, as well as Dr. David Nabarro, the Secretary-General's Special Envoy for Ebola.
**Libya
And on Libya, the UN Support Mission for Libya (UNSMIL) expressed concern about reported breaches of the ceasefire that the parties to the conflict had unilaterally declared earlier this week. The Mission continues to urge the parties to discuss and commit to concrete measures to consolidate the truce and tackle any violation as soon as possible. The Mission views any violation, no matter how limited, as a grave development that could undermine the entire truce. More information is available online.
**Iraq
 

And regarding Iraq, the Da'esh group, also known as ISIL [Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham], has established unlawful, so-called ""shari'a courts"" in the territory under its control that have been meting out cruel and inhuman punishments, according to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). In its Geneva briefing, the Human Rights Office said that, last week, the Da'esh posted photos on the web of two men being ""crucified"" after they were accused of banditry. Photos were also posted of a woman being stoned to death, allegedly for adultery.
The Office has received numerous other reports of women who have been executed by Da'esh in Mosul and other areas under the group's control, often immediately following sentences passed by its so-called courts. Educated, professional women, particularly women who have run as candidates in elections for public office seem to be particularly at risk. The Human Rights Office is continuing to document human rights abuses and violations taking place in Iraq and will present a report to the Human Rights Council in March.
**Syria
And from Syria, the heavy snow storm in January hit thousands of Syrian families living in makeshift dwellings and slowed down the World Food Programme's (WFP) planned food distributions inside Syria. WFP and its partners have mobilized emergency food and other supplies to the most affected communities. The World Food Programme has also appealed for more than $1.5 billion to feed over 6.5 million people inside Syria and sheltering in neighbouring countries. The funding situation remains critical; without enough funds, WFP will be unable to provide assistance at the same levels as before, so people will receive only 70 per cent of their previous entitlement.
**Malawi
And from Malawi, our humanitarian colleagues are reporting that, according to governmental estimates, some 121,000 people have been displaced by the flooding in the country. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that search and rescue operations continue and relief supplies are being dispatched to affected area. For example, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) has received 75 drums of chlorine to treat water; and the World Food Programme has started food distribution. A UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination team has also been deployed to Malawi.
**Death Penalty
And also from Geneva, the Office for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights today expressed its concern over the continued use of the death penalty for drug crimes in parts of South-East Asia. Last Sunday, six people were convicted of drug offences and were executed in Indonesia, despite several national and international appeals. The Office said that 60 others remain on death row for drug-related offences. And more information is available online.
**Appointment
A personnel appointment today: The Secretary-General has appointed Eric Goosby of the United States as the UN Special Envoy on Tuberculosis. Dr. Goosby was formerly the Ambassador-at-Large and United States Global AIDS Coordinator, appointed by President Barack Obama. He led all US Government international HIV/AIDS efforts from 2009 to 2013. Dr. Goosby will work towards raising the profile of the fight against tuberculosis and promoting the adoption, financing and implementation of the World Health Organization's global ""End TB Strategy"" after 2015. There's more information on the appointment in my office.
**Earlier Questions
And yesterday, I was told there were some questions, I think from you, Matthew, about Chadian troops in the UN [Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization] Mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA. And I can tell you that UN Peacekeeping has been working to improve the conditions in the camps in Kidal, Aguelhok and Tessalit, where Chadian troops are based. And DPKO [Department of Peacekeeping Operations] is also coordinating with Chad and other troop-contributing countries for a rotation plan for Aguelhok. The rotation is planned to start on 1 February.
**Press Conferences
And tomorrow, a press conference - 12:30 p.m., briefing here by members of the Commission of Inquiry on the Central African Republic.
**Questions and Answers
Question: Does the SecretaryaEUR'General have a comment on the situation of IS [Islamic State] Japanese hostages? And given Japan's hands are tied by Security Council resolution 2133 (2014)on ransom payment,
 

what immediate resources can the SecretaryaEUR'General and the UN provide on this kind of sensitive issue?
Spokesman: Obviously, the SecretaryaEUR'General is very concerned about the fate of these two hostages we saw the video - as he is concerned of the fate of all people that have been taken hostage by armed groups, especially Da'esh and other armed groups, whether it be in Iraq or Syria. And once again, he calls for the immediate release of all hostages. Masood?
Question: Stephane, now that the United States has... is not demanding any more that the Syrian President, [Bashar] al-Assad, be ousted before any peace talks, does the SecretaryaEUR'General think the peace talks in Syria between the opposition and the Government forces have now any chance of success?
Spokesman: Well, obviously, you know, the SecretaryaEUR'General, through the efforts of his Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, has been focusing both on creating this freeze in Aleppo and on getting traction in the political track. The SecretaryaEUR'General has always believed that everyone, that the opposition and the Government both need to sit at the table and we remain committed to working towards these political discussions.
Question: Stephane, followaEUR'up on that ... ?
Spokesman: One second. I think your colleague Masood himself had a followaEUR'up on his own question. So, let's go...
Question: The followaEUR'up is this. So, in that case, the peace talks that the SecretaryaEUR'General are now going to be... are in process of being held or... ?
Spokesman: No, I think that, as you know, discussions are still going on at various levels. There is a Russian initiative, for which the Office of the Special Envoy will be represented, but obviously, we continue to have discussions at many different levels, but there is nothing new to announce from the Office of the Special Envoy. Nizar?
Question: Yep. How do... how does the United Nations view the recent attack by the Israelis yesterday, or the day before yesterday, on those who are fighting ISIS and AlaEUR'Nusra near the Golan, in the context of peace initiative, foreign interference trying to... and of course, the escalation and tension and rhetoric in the region is escalating, of course?
Spokesman: I think, yesterday, we gave you what our colleagues at the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) noticed and reported back to us. Obviously, the increase of violence that we see throughout the region remains of great concern to us.
Correspondent: But, yesterday, the statement was short of telling the identity of the aircraft which attacked those who were there. And also today there are a lot of threats from both sides of the...
Spokesman: Well, obviously, you know, we're hoping that none of these threats come to fruition and we call for a lowering of the rhetoric. That's what I have... Nizar, I promise I will come back to you before the end of the week. Matthew?
Question: Sure. I wanted to ask about the reports confirmed by... to some degree, by the mission to some media in the Central African Republic of a UN staff member being taken hostage by antiaEUR'Balaka. Is it true? What's the UN doing about it?
Spokesman: What we know is that a staff member was detained for some time this morning in Bangui. She's now been released and she is either back in the hands of the UN or on her way back to the hands of the UN, so she's safely released and we're obviously very pleased.
Question: And is the... does the UN have any involvement in trying to free this French aid worker who was also taken hostage earlier in the week?
Spokesman: I have no information on that. Lou and then Sylviane?
Question: Thanks. Does the SecretaryaEUR'General have a position on the situation in Haiti, where the political crisis has been escalating, and you know, came to a new... reached a new development over the weekend with appointment of a new Government?
Spokesman: Well, you know, obviously, we're very keen on the Haitian authorities finding a way forward to get... to find a way out of the current political crisis and find the stability that Haiti needs to move forward. Sylviane?
 

Question: I would like to ask you again what is the UN reaction on the Israeli air strike that killed several Hezbollah fighters in southern Syria? And also, this morning, at 10 a.m., Mr. [Derek] Plumbly met with SecretaryaEUR'General. Do you have any readout?
Spokesman: No, I believe that must have been a farewell call. As you know, his successor, Ms. [Sigrid] Kaag, has now taken over her post in Beirut. So, I'm sure it was a way for... it was a chance for the SecretaryaEUR'General to say ""thank you"" to Mr. Plumbly for his work. And I think, as you will have heard yesterday, the UN Mission was not in a position to certify the identity of the aircraft. I think what is being implied in your questions is not something that we were confirming. Ken and then Iftikhar, and then we'll go to the back.
Question: Thanks, Stephane. Over the weekend, it's been reported Mr. Shin Dong yuk, one of the... a defector from North Korea -- DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] -- contributed to the COI [Commission of Inquiry] report... admitted that part of his testimony was not correct. Do you think this will affect at all to the credibility of the COI report?
Spokesman: I haven't seen that report. I will take a look at it and get back to you. Iftikhar, then...
Question: This is a follow-up to Masood's questions. Just to be specific, are you confirming that the demand for President Bashar al-Assad's removal has been dropped?
Spokesman: I... you know, I think what our focus now is to find a political solution. The SecretaryaEUR'General has always believed, and his envoys have always believed, that the parties need to be... . all the parties need to be represented at the table. Mr. Abbadi, and then we'll go to Go.
Question: Thank you, Stephane. What does the SecretaryaEUR'General think of the flagellation? Does he think it's a form of torture?
Spokesman: I think... in general? It sounds to me like it's a form of cruel and unusual punishment. Yes. There, then Somini... feel free to come closer. My eyesight is bad. Yes, go ahead. Yes, I did call on you. Please use your microphone.
Question: I'm sorry?
Spokesman: Please use your microphone. Thank you. No, you need to press the button. Thank you.
Correspondent: Sorry.
Spokesman: And if you don't mind identifying yourself because I don't know you.
Question: Yeah, I'm Jamie Schram with The New York Post. I'm curious about the ISIL courts in Iraq. How does that work? I mean, are there prosecutors, defence attorneys, judges? You know, what's the story here with that?
Spokesman: Well, I don't... obviously, we don't have the details, since we're not there. What the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights was condemning the action of these soaEUR'called courts that have been set up under ISIL or Da'esh control.
Question: I guess I'm confused. How does he know that these are even... I mean, how does he know about the existence of the courts if he doesn't know anything about the dynamic here?
Spokesman: Obviously, we're getting reports from what it is going on in the area.
Question: And do any of those reports indicate, like, judge, prosecutor, defence attorney?
Spokesman: Well, I think what is clear from the reporting the High Commissioner is getting is that these courts, I think, would not stand up to the minimum legal requirements that most of us would accept.
Question: So, it's like a kangaroo court?
Spokesman: You're welcome to use that term. And I can refer you to the High Commissioner for Human Rights for more information. Somini?
Question: Thank you, Stephane. Is there a new date for when Mr. de Mistura is going to be briefing the Council on Syria? And relatedly, has the SecretaryaEUR'General said anything about the Russian proposals for talks sometime later this month?
Spokesman: Mr. de Mistura, I think, has spoken and the Russian proposal and said he's obviously in very close touch with the Russian authorities and that his office will be represented at those events. Go?
 

Question: Thank you, Stephane. One follow-up on these two Japanese abducted men by ISIS. So, ISIS is demanding not to change the policy of the Japanese Government over the Middle East, but they're asking for a ransom, even by precising the amount of the ransom to $200 million. Do you have any specific comment on that?
Spokesman: Obviously, the release of hostages should be done unconditionally. Oleg, you may go now.
Question: Thank you, Stephane. One quick question: There is a session of the Security Council scheduled on Ukraine tomorrow. I know it's not decided whether it's going to be open or closed, but was there any request to the Secretariat to have a briefer or something?
Spokesman: I'm not aware of it, but that doesn't mean there hasn't been one. But I will check. Roger? Sorry, then Linda, sorry.
Question: Thanks. I understand a letter was sent over the weekend to the SecretaryaEUR'General from 80 leading humanitarian organizations, implicitly criticizing the idea that Andrew Lansley would be appointed as Valerie Amos' replacement at OCHA. Has the SecretaryaEUR'General received the letter and... ?
Spokesman: I don't... I don't know if he's received it, but obviously, the search process is ongoing. I think people may be getting ahead of themselves. I think people have a right... you know, groups and others have obviously a right to express their opinion, but the selection process will be done per usual practice, and as we've already said here, there was a call for nominations from Member States.
Correspondent: Sorry. There's also a petition with about 70,000 names, just to let you know.
Spokesman: I'll see if we received it. [He later said the petition has not been received.] Linda?
Question: Stephane, apropos of the Japanese nationals who are being held, we know, for example, that Japan and the United States has policies of not wanting to pay ransom; yet, we know that there have been a number of hostages where countries, including in Europe somewhere or other have paid ransom and the abductees have been released. Is there... does the [Secretary-General] or is there a UN reaction to clearly what... to payments of ransom, which is clearly not endorsed?
Spokesman: It's not up to the SecretaryaEUR'General to dictate and to speak to that. What we are... in terms of what countries are doing to release their nationals. What is clear from our point of view is that their release needs to be unconditional. Sylviane and then Nizar?
Question: I'm returning to this question on Syria and Aleppo. Can you be more specific? Can you describe what is the meaning of freezing the situation in Aleppo? Because the fight is still raging...
Spokesman: Obviously, the freeze...
Question: And how can you... how can you be optimistic about it?
Spokesman: Well, it's, you know, I think what we've seen is that the fighting in Syria is one of the biggest challenges that we face today. It has had untold humanitarian impact on millions of people, both within Syria and now who have been forced to leave Syria. It's also had a destabilizing impact on the region as a whole. We have had, since the beginning of this crisis, multiple diplomatic efforts to try to halt the fighting. The freeze as proposed by Mr. de Mistura is a first step is to try to get a stop to the fighting, a freeze to the fighting in one place, and to then build on that. Obviously, I think Aleppo is emblematic of what has been going on in Syria as a whole. The destruction there has been massive. The suffering has been massive, and it's about starting somewhere. We're not there yet, but we have to start somewhere.
Correspondent: Yeah, you said Nizar first.
Spokesman: I said later this week, but go ahead.
Question: Are we receiving any reports from Iraq regarding why some Yazidi civilians were released by ISIS or Da'esh? Also, there are other reports coming from Iraq, saying that some air drops by the allies have been... of weapons and supplies were dropped in the ISIS area and this is... this happened frequently, not just one or a couple of occasions. There were also videos showing these air drops on YouTube and other media, social media. Did you get anything from your mission about that?
Spokesman: No, I have not. On the people who were freed, the Yazidis who were freed, I can't tell you why they were freed. This is not the right place... I'm not the right person to ask. What I can tell you is that on the humanitarian front, our colleagues, our humanitarian colleagues, including WFP, UNHCR [Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] have been there to help to receive them and to help to provide them, whether it's transport or shelter. Mr....
 

Question: How about air drops?
Spokesman: I have nothing on that. Mr. Abbadi? Can you use your microphone, please?
Question: What does the SecretaryaEUR'General have to say on the day of Martin Luther King, [Jr.,] fighter for peace and racial harmony?
Spokesman: I think what he would say is his message of nonviolence and peace and harmony is as valid today, if not more valid today, than it has ever been. Mr. Lee?
Correspondent: Sure, Stephane.
Spokesman: I'm sorry. Linda. Did I never get to you? Linda. I'll come back to you then. Sorry.
Question: Yeah, I wanted... on a couple of problematic things that came up, you've always said, you know, that the missions are looking into it and they will in due course. I wanted to ask about two those. Two has to do with the videotaped shooting by MINUSTAH (United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti] peacekeepers in Haiti into a crowd of demonstrators. Where does it stand?
Spokesman: Very valid question. I will ask.
Question: And even further back, the downing of a UN helicopter, which killed its pilots in South Sudan in August, where there's audiotape of Peter Gadet saying, ""I will shoot helicopters down."" Some are now saying that the UN is never going to release a report, out of fear that other helicopters will be shot down by the Gadet forces. Can you... ?
Spokesman: I will ask the mission.
Question: How long is too long? What's... I guess I want to know from you now, like, six months from now, is it still not going to come out? Is there some minimum... ?
Spokesman: How long is too long is a question I will not answer.
Question: For you. How long is too long for you as the Spokesperson?
Spokesman: Halas, as they say. No, joking aside, I will ask. Linda?
Question: Stephane, can you share with us what the status of the UN presence in the ISIL or ISIS area is, and perhaps how... are they providing humanitarian aid or what's going on there?
Spokesman: As far as I know, we don't have anyone in the areas that are exactly under control of Da'esh. We're providing humanitarian support in areas where we're able to operate safely or at least where we're able to manage the risk, but I can get you an update on where we are in Iraq and Syria. Nizar, and that will be it.
Question: On Yemen, obviously, the AlaEUR'Qaida influence is growing in many areas. Has the United Nations identified the sources of the weapons they are getting or the sources of financial aid they are receiving?
Spokesman: Obviously, we don't have an investigative mechanism to track down where the weapons are coming from and whether it's Iraq or whether... you know, whether it's Syria or Yemen. We would encourage all those who have an influence over the parties to exercise that influence. What I would add to on Yemen is Mr. Benomar, who briefed from Doha, is trying to make his way back to Yemen to be there as soon as possible to personally engage in discussions there. Matthew?
Question: Sure. I wanted to ask, because it's in the news, Bahrain has sentenced Nabeel Rajab for six months in jail for a single tweet. As a tweeter yourself, I'd like to know: what do you think of it? I know there's a general policy, but it seems like things are getting... the length of time for the amount of communication is...
Spokesman: We're... I'm expecting something on that later today, but obviously, I think it's important that people have the right to express themselves freely.
Question: A follow-up on that? Well, today there are many people injured in Bahrain as a result of the crackdown by the police. Do you have any... ?
Spokesman: I have nothing more than what we've already said on Bahrain. Thank you.",Daily Press Briefing By the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General [document],All Africa AFNWS English 
21 January 2015,Liberia_1.pdf,"21 January 2015 22:02 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2015 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved
Jan 21, 2015 (United Nations/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Seized with a succession of new crises in Europe, the Middle East and across Africa, the Security Council in 2014 tackled an expanding workload in a record number of meetings while seeking to defeat terrorism, prevent conflicts, protect civilians, and improve the effectiveness of sanctions and other tools to quell tensions and neutralize threats.
In total, the Council this year convened 241 public meetings, up sharply from the 172 held in 2013. There were eight high-level meetings, including notably a September summit of Heads of State and Government on terrorism, as the unparalleled brutal tactics of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Sham (ISIL/ISIS) and other groups swept across Iraq and Syria and regions in Africa.
In country- or region-specific situations, about 55 per cent of the Council's meetings related to Africa, compared to 2013, when 75 per cent concerned that continent. Europe was addressed in 28 per cent of meetings as political turmoil in Ukraine turned into full-blown conflict in the country's east.
Africa certainly remained a major concern with the situation in Sudan and South Sudan the subject of most of those meetings, after the political dispute in South Sudan devolved into factional violence that sent up to 100,000 people fleeing to United Nations bases. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa was deemed a new threat to international peace and security as it grew exponentially in three countries emerging from conflict; a resolution countering isolation of those countries and mobilizing aid had the most sponsors in the Council's history.
In addition, with last year's political crisis in the Central African Republic spiralling into inter-community violence, the Council approved the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission there, known as MINUSCA. Council members visited Mali as the peacekeeping operation there suffered numerous attacks in the restive north. The body also addressed a new round of deep instability in Libya.
In the Middle East, the Council ramped up its meetings on the Palestinian question as hope for negotiations faded and a war erupted between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, leaving thousands dead. With hundreds of thousands killed and little political progress in Syria, the humanitarian situation there was deemed a separate threat to international peace, resulting in actions on humanitarian access. The situation in Yemen was also newly deemed a threat with international import amid fresh assaults on the democratic transition, against which the Council targeted a new sanctions regime.
Elsewhere, the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea became its own agenda item, apart from considerations of its item on non-proliferation, after a horrifying human rights report was sent to the Council by the General Assembly, which urged referral to the International Criminal Court. On Afghanistan, the Council shepherded the end of the transition to national control of the security sector, as insurgent attacks again took a significant toll.
Addressing these situations and dozens of others, the Council adopted 63 resolutions and issued 28 presidential statements. Once again it strove for consensus, with only three texts adopted through a vote, although a year-end draft requiring a lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict within three years failed to obtain the needed majority.
Two other texts -- one that would have termed invalid a referendum in Crimea that preceded its joining the Russian Federation and one on referring gross human rights violations in Syria to the International Criminal Court -- were vetoed by the Russian Federation, along with China in the latter case, again showing the divisions that constrained action on some of the most difficult situations.
In the interest of improving effectiveness and transparency in those and all other areas, October's day-long debate on working methods drew 55 speakers with much attention given to the current use of sanctions and
 

referrals to the International Criminal Court. The first focused assessment of sanctions since 2006 was also conducted.
More emphasis on conflict prevention was urged at all opportunities for Council self-evaluation; signs of potential crises were increasingly discussed under the item ""Other issues"". Prevention was also a central focus of a visiting mission to Europe on the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War, after which Council members visited South Sudan, where the mandate of the peacekeeping mission was adjusted to better protect civilians seeking refuge at United Nations bases.
The Council's ability to adapt to changing challenges was also a focus in open thematic meetings on improving the deployment of police in United Nations peacekeeping operations, as well as on protecting and empowering women, children and other civilians in the context of massive displacement and the ever more brutal face of terrorism.
In addition to its meetings on terrorism, the Council issued 138 press statements, at least 90 of which condemned particular terrorist acts around the world. It continued to monitor compliance with counter-terrorism resolutions through its subsidiary bodies, calling special attention to efforts to keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists on the tenth anniversary of resolution 1540 (2004).
Aside from MINUSCA, the Council authorized no new peacekeeping operations in 2014. It did, however, terminate the mandates in four Special Political Missions: the peacebuilding offices in the Central African Republic (BINUCA), Burundi (BNUB), and Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) and the Joint Mission with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which completed its work of destroying declared materials in Syria.
Public monthly wrap-ups of the Council's work were held, for the first time since 2005, under Rwanda's presidency. With the aim of analysing the month's activities, the presidencies of the United Kingdom, Argentina, Australia and Chad followed suit.
In its October elections this year, the General Assembly choose Angola, Malaysia, New Zealand, Spain and Venezuela to serve two-year terms as non-permanent Council members, starting on 1 January 2015. They replaced Argentina, Australia, Luxembourg, Republic of Korea and Rwanda, which concluded their terms on 31 December 2014. Chad, Chile, Jordan, Lithuania and Nigeria will complete their terms at the end of 2015. China, France, Russian Federation, United Kingdom and the United States are permanent Council members.
Following is a guide to the Council's public meetings on all agenda items in 2014:
Africa
Sahel
3 meetings: 19 June, 27 August, 11 December
1 presidential statement: 27 August
The Security Council renewed its commitment to addressing the complex challenges of the parched sub-Saharan region in a presidential statement on 27 August, expressing grave concern about resurgent terrorism and emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive and coordinated approach that encompassed governance, security, humanitarian, human rights and development efforts. That statement followed a 19 June briefing by the Special Envoy for the Sahel, Hiroute Guebre Sellassie, who called for urgent implementation of the Integrated Strategy for the Sahel endorsed by the Council last year, and also warned of the growing terrorist threat along with the food insecurity affecting at least 20 million people. In her 11 December briefing, Ms. Sellassie said that links between terrorist and criminal networks in Libya, Mali and northern Nigeria were becoming clearer while humanitarian indicators across the Sahel remained disquieting, with food insecurity, malnutrition, and displacements on the rise.
West Africa
1 meeting: 8 July
The Head of the United Nations Office for West Africa (UNOWA), Said Djinnit, briefing the Council on 8 July, said that there had been remarkable strides in the stabilization of Mali and Guinea-Bissau along with high economic growth in the region, but that new crises such as Ebola and the terrorism of Boko Haram and other groups made it more difficult to address development. Upcoming challenges also included elections planned for 2015 in Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Niger and Nigeria, some of which had very polarized environments.
Ebola
 

3 meetings: 18 September, 14 October, 21 November
1 resolution: 2177
1 presidential statement: 21 November
With most of its members calling the spread of Ebola in West Africa this year a threat to peace and security due to its scale and the destabilizing effect it posed to post-conflict countries, the Council met three times on the epidemic. On 18 September, it called on Member States through resolution 2177 (2014) to respond urgently to the crisis and to refrain from isolating the affected countries -- Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone -- after being briefed on the exponential spread of the disease by the Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Ebola, David Nabarro, as well as the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Margaret Chan, and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who announced the establishment of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, or UNMEER, which aimed to contain the outbreak, treat the infected, and help preserve stability.
On 14 October, Mr. Nabarro and other officials of the United Nations and affected countries continued to sound the alarm on Ebola, expressing gratitude for international aid and pleading for enough to meet the magnitude of the threat. States described extensive assistance efforts, and on 21 November the Council, through a presidential statement, welcomed progress in slowing the spread, with Mr. Nabarro confirming that the response capacities available to the affected countries had ""expanded substantially"". Nevertheless, he warned that much remained to be done to end the epidemic.
Sierra Leone
1 meeting: 26 March
1 presidential statement: 26 March
As the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone (UNIPSIL) prepared for its final drawdown at the end of March, the Council welcomed what it called the West African country's ""remarkable achievements"" in recovering from its brutal civil war, in a presidential statement on 26 March. Briefing during that meeting, Executive Representative and Head of UNIPSIL Anders Toyberg-Frandzen said that much progress had been made in security, justice and governance but challenges linked to the war's root causes such as pervasive poverty and a constricted political space required sustained international support.
Liberia
6 meetings: 20 March, 9 September, 15 September, 12 November, 9 December, 15 December
3 resolutions: 2176, 2188, 2190
The Council's focus on Liberia was dominated by the outbreak of the Ebola virus, which had presented the West African country with its gravest threat since the ruinous civil war of the 1990s and forced the United Nations Mission there (UNMIL) to postpone planned drawdowns and reorient its activities. In a 9 September briefing, the Secretary-General's Special Representative said the speed and scale of the loss of life -- and the economic, social, political and security reverberations of the crisis -- were having profound effects: extreme testing of still-weak State institutions, public anger and alarm, and setbacks in the political process.
One week later, on 15 September, the Council extended UNMIL's mandate until 31 December 2014 with no changes to deployment, but expressed its intention to further extend the mandate to 30 September 2015 after considering the Secretary-General's proposals for the Mission's future. By 12 November, the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations said that, even with the scaled up international response to the Ebola crisis, Liberia's very existence was at stake. The international community must provide whatever assistance it could, perhaps most critically for post-Ebola reconstruction.
On 9 December, the Council renewed sanctions on Liberia for a further nine months, while recognizing Ebola's impact as a factor in any decisions to modify or lift them. There had been few signs early in the year that a health emergency of this size would bring about such change. On 20 March, the Secretary-General's Special Representative had reported widespread public dissatisfaction with national authorities in different sectors, marked by protests and low trust in the criminal justice system.
Guinea-Bissau
4 meetings: 26 February, 29 May, 18 November, 25 November
2 resolutions: 2157, 2186
 

The holding of national elections in April was critical to consolidating constitutional order and stability in Guinea-Bissau in the wake of its 2012 coup d'etat, Special Representative Jose Ramos-Horta told the Council on 26 February. On 18 November, following successful polling and the formation of an inclusive Government, a new Special Representative, Miguel Trovoada, praised the country for its progress, but warned that political parties still remained divided, some institutions functioned poorly and suspicion remained between civilian and military sectors. He urged continued international support to maintain gains that had been achieved. The Council then decided, on 25 November, to extend the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau (UNIOGBIS) for three months, awaiting an assessment report on mandate adjustments, having previously extended the mandate on 29 May for six months.
Mali
9 meetings: 16 January, 23 January, 26 February, 23 April, 20 May, 18 June, 25 June, 28 July, 8 October
1 resolution: 2164
2 presidential statements: 23 January, 28 July
Attacks by armed groups and a lack of national institutions in the north of Mali set back progress in recovery from the coup d'etat and insurgency that had led to the 2013 deployment of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the country known as MINUSMA, the Council was told in an 8 October briefing by Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Herve Ladsous. He reported that 31 peacekeepers from the Mission had been slain and 66 wounded since the Mission's deployment; the drawdown of French forces and the ""quasi-disappearance"" of Malian Armed Forces had made MINUSMA the only hedge to the territorial advances of the armed groups, some with ties to terrorists. He called for agreements to be reached through ongoing negotiations to make possible a consensus-based return of national institutions in the north.
The importance of moving forward on peace agreements, leading to stable institutions and development, was underlined by the leader of the Council visiting mission to the country, French Ambassador Gerard Araud, in a 26 February briefing on the trip, which had taken place between 31 January and 3 February. The extreme fragility of the situation was emphasized by MINUSMA head Albert Koenders in briefings on 16 January, 23 April and 20 May, the latter after major attacks on the northern town of Kidal. In a presidential statement read out on 28 July, the Council underscored the importance of inclusive negotiations open to all communities in northern Mali, commending the parties on dialogue held in Algiers in July and urging implementation of all agreed confidence-building measures. On 25 June, the Council extended MINUSMA's mandate for one year with an authorized troop ceiling of 11,200 military and 1,440 police personnel and with a focus on civilian protection, stabilization and assisting in re-establishment of State authority.
Central African Republic
11 meetings: 6 January, 22 January, 28 January, 20 February, 6 March, 10 April, 24 June, 11 July, 19 August, 21 October, 9 December
3 resolutions: 2134, 2149, 2181
In its major move to stem the violence in the Central African Republic that spiralled throughout 2013 -- when mainly Muslim Seleka rebels swept briefly into power, followed by increasingly sectarian carnage with the rise of the mainly Christian anti-Balaka militias -- the Council on 10 April established the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) for an initial one-year period, authorizing the deployment of up to 10,000 military and 1,800 police personnel. By resolution 2149 (2014), it also decided that the transfer of authority from the African Union-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic (MISCA) to MINUSCA would take place on 15 September 2014. On 9 December, the Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations in a briefing said MINUSCA would achieve 80 per cent of its full troop deployment that month.
Those actions built on decisions taken at the start of the year to improve the ""greatly deteriorated"" situation in the country. On 28 January, through resolution 2134 (2014), the Council extended the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA) for one year, expanded sanctions on individuals to include a travel ban and an assets freeze and authorized the deployment of a European Union intervention force for a six-month period, beginning once full operational capacity was reached.
On 20 February, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon presented a six-point plan that urged rapid deployment of at least 3,000 more troops and police in the Central African Republic to reinforce existing African Union and French forces, also proposing that those be brought under a single command, with a view to the handover to a future United Nations peacekeeping operation there. Such a coordinated command would oversee all international forces in the country that are focused on containing the violence, protecting civilians, preventing  

further displacements, creating a secure environment for humanitarian aid delivery and laying the groundwork for the handover.
On 21 October, the Council authorized an extension of the European Union operation until 15 March 2015.
Throughout the year, the Council heard briefings on the situation by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, the Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, the Special Representative on Sexual Violence and Armed Conflict, the Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, and the Chair of the Committee established pursuant to resolution 2127 (2013), all of whom spoke to the ""spiral of vengeance"" that was destroying the social fabric and undermining trust. The Special Representative and Head of MINUSCA underlined the radicalization of the anti-balaka and Seleka rebels.
Central African Region
2 meetings: 12 May, 10 December
2 presidential statements: 12 May, 10 December
The Council's two meetings on the Central African region tackled the continued threat of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), expansion of Boko Haram terrorist acts, piracy in the Gulf of Guinea and the crisis in the Central African Republic, which threatened the subregion from within. A year-end presidential statement also expressed concern about the illegal wildlife trade and transnational organized crime. The United Nations Regional Office there (UNOCA), as well as the regional United Nations political and peacekeeping missions, was urged to do more to support implementation of the United Nations Regional Strategy to Address the Threat and Impact of the Activities of the LRA, whose leader, said the Special Envoy of the African Union for LRA issues, was still on the run. A second statement, issued in May, condemned the crimes against humanity carried out by the LRA. The outgoing Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of UNOCA cautioned that violence in Sudan had jeopardized African Union efforts to eliminate the LRA, with Uganda and South Sudan withdrawing troops from the African Union's regional intervention forces.
Democratic Republic of the Congo
7 meetings: 13 January, 30 January, 14 March, 28 March, 7 August, 27 October, 5 November
2 resolutions: 2136, 2147
1 presidential statement: 5 November
Continuing to focus on protection of civilians in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and the need for that purpose to neutralize armed groups there, the Council this year closely watched efforts to follow up on the dissolution in 2013 of the 23 March Movement (M23), as well as agreements for the disarmament of the Forces democratiques de liberation du Rwanda (FDLR) by 2 January 2015. With delays in both processes, on 5 November the Council called on the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) and the Congolese Government to immediately prepare for military actions against members of the latter group who failed to disarm or continued to carry out rights abuses. It also condemned the massacre of some 100 people in Beni by another group, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), and called for action against it.
That statement followed briefings by the head of MONUSCO, Martin Kobler, in meetings on 13 January, which also included a statement by Mary Robinson, Special Envoy for the Great Lakes, 14 March, 7 August and 27 October, in which he called for robust tactics to protect civilians from all armed groups, guided by those utilized in the defeat of the M23 in conjunction with the innovative Force Intervention Brigade. ""Presence without action, in the face of violence, undermines our credibility,"" he said. The continuation of the Intervention Brigade was included in MONUSCO's mandate when it was extended for one year on 28 March. With that extension, the Council kept the troop ceiling at nearly 20,000, but noted the need for a clear exit strategy in line with the evolving situation. On 30 January, the Council renewed the arms embargo and related measures imposed on the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
South Sudan
9 meetings: 18 March, 2 May, 12 May, 27 May, 6 August, 8 August, 22 October, 25 November, 15 December
2 resolutions: 2155, 2187
2 presidential statements: 8 August, 15 December
The Council had to reorient the mandate of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) this year, after political in-fighting that started in 2013 turned into widespread civil violence, causing nearly 100,000  

civilians to take refuge at the Mission's bases. On 18 March, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Herve Ladsous told the Council that the Mission would suspend its current activities to re-focus on protecting civilians, facilitating assistance, monitoring human rights, preventing further intercommunal violence and supporting the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD) peacemaking efforts. UNMISS was authorized to ""use all necessary means"" to accomplish those tasks and its deployment ceiling was increased to 12,500 troops and 1,323 police in two extension resolutions, the most recent of which kept the mandate in place until 30 May 2015.
High United Nations officials visited the country as the violence spread and they reported to the Council. On 2 May, High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay and Adama Dieng, Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, warned of a spiralling humanitarian crisis amid revenge killings and impending famine. Following his visit, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he had urged both South Sudanese leaders, President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar Teny, to heal the wounds they had opened and implement the agreement brokered by IGAD in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on 9 May.
Following a 6 August briefing in which Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Edmond Mulet warned that the rival parties must embark on reconciliation or risk a humanitarian catastrophe, the Council issued a presidential statement urging them to honour their agreements. Marking the one-year anniversary of the outbreak of conflict through another statement on 15 December, Council members placed full responsibility on the clashing leaders for what they called tragic events, which had killed tens of thousands. They demanded full implementation of all accords and reiterated intentions to consider measures against those impeding the peace process.
Sudan/South Sudan (Abyei)
2 meetings: 29 May, 14 October
2 resolutions: 2156, 2179
In two meetings to extend the mandate of the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) -created in 2011 after Sudanese troops took over the disputed, oil-rich area weeks before South Sudan became independent -- the Council made no changes in the mandate but continued to demand progress in resolving outstanding issues between the parties along with implementation of local governance, security and confidence-building mechanisms required by a 2011 agreement.
Darfur
10 meetings: 23 January, 13 February, 3 April, 24 April, 17 June, 7 August, 27 August, 24 November, 4 December, 12 December
3 resolutions: 2138, 2148, 2173
With security and humanitarian conditions in Sudan's Darfur region repeatedly described by briefers as ""deteriorating"", despite some progress in the Doha peace process meant to end the fighting between the Government, allied militias and rebel movements, the Council focused on improving the impact on the ground of the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID). Following a review of the Operation, the rationale of which was described by Peacekeeping head Herve Ladsous in his January briefing, the Council endorsed a resulting set of recommendations from the Secretary-General through resolution 2148 (2014) that set UNAMID's priorities as civilian protection, facilitation and protection of humanitarian aid operations, and mediation between the Government and non-signatories to the peace process, along with mediation between communities, as inter-group conflict continued to beset the region. The realignment, which included streamlined deployment, was again affirmed through resolution 2173 (2014), which renewed the Operation's mandate until 25 June 2015. On 24 November, the expert panel monitoring sanctions on Sudan was extended 13 months, until the end of 2015.
In the remainder of briefings during the year, the Council was told that UNAMID's effort to carry out its mandate continued to be hindered by attacks against peacekeepers and surges in fighting, criminal acts, and movement restrictions by Government forces, armed forces and militia groups. In his December briefing, Mr. Ladsous also enumerated attacks against civilians by Arab militias, Government forces and unidentified armed elements during the reporting period, along with increased displacement and worsening criminality and intercommunal violence. Tensions between the Government and UNAMID had heightened over access issues, including to investigate allegations of a mass rape in North Darfur, as well as a demand for the departure of two human rights experts.
In her two semi-annual briefings to the Council, Fatou Bensouda, Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, said that systematic human rights crimes continued to be committed with total impunity in Darfur 10 years since the situation was referred to the Court. ""It is an understatement to say that we have failed Darfur's victims who continue to bear the brunt of these crimes,"" she stated. She regretted, in particular, that the  

Council had not acted to bring to justice those indicted for alleged war crimes, including President Omer al-Bashir, for alleged crimes committed in Darfur. As a result, she announced in her December briefing that she was left with no choice but to put investigative activities in Darfur on hold.
Somalia
9 meetings: 5 March, 11 March, 22 May, 29 May, 4 June, 14 October, 22 October, 24 October, 12 November
4 resolutions: 2142, 2158, 2182, 2184
1 presidential statement: 22 May
The nine meetings convened on the situation in Somalia focused on fostering economic opportunity, preventing piracy and blunting revenue streams of Al-Shabaab, the Islamist militia which had seen ""significant reverses"" towards year-end following a joint military offensive between the Somali National Army and the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). Calls for maintaining a focus on Somalia and seizing opportunities to brighten its future reverberated throughout the year during briefings by the Secretary-General's Special Representative, the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, and the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.
The Council adopted four resolutions in 2014 aimed at stabilizing security, with three of them under the Charter's Chapter VII, which covers acts of aggression and threats to peace.
Perhaps its biggest action was the adoption of resolution 2182 (2014) on 24 October by a vote of 13 in favour to none against, with 2 abstentions (Jordan, Russian Federation), authorizing the African Union to maintain deployment of AMISOM until 30 November 2015 and amending several aspects of the sanctions regime against the country. Among the adjustments, it authorized action by Member States to stop the illegal trade in charcoal, which was providing a financial ""lifeline"" for Al-Shabaab. It renewed its partial lifting of the arms embargo for the security forces of the Federal Government until 30 October 2015, first decided on 5 March. In their abstentions, Jordan's delegate argued that the new text could be abused by allowing vessels to be inspected under subjective criteria, while the Russian Federation's delegate said such concerns should have received more attention.
To counter piracy, the Council renewed for another year authorizations first agreed in 2008 for international action to fight that crime. Specifically, it called on States and regional organizations to fight sea crimes by deploying, among other things, naval vessels, arms and military aircraft.
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia -- established on 2 May 2013 -- passed its one-year anniversary with the Council's 29 May renewal of its mandate for another year and expansion of its work to include support for peacebuilding and State-building.
Earlier, the Council, in a 22 May presidential statement, had expressed its continued concern about the diversion of arms and ammunition, including potentially to Al-Shabaab.
Cote d'Ivoire
5 meetings: 27 January, 29 April, 16 June, 25 June, 29 October
2 resolutions: 2153, 2162
Noting progress in political reconciliation in Cote d'Ivoire but remaining concerned over security in the context of the planned October 2015 national elections, the Council, on 25 June, extended the mandate of the United Nations Operation in the country, known as UNOCI, until 30 June 2015 while reducing its military component and expressing its intention for further reductions as well as the possible termination of the Operation after those polls. In the same context, the Council partially lifted the arms embargo and terminated the diamond trade ban on 29 April by resolution 2153 (2014), although in a subsequent briefing by the Chair of the 1572 Committee, on 29 October, concern was expressed over frictions between the parties that had fought in the 2010 electoral crisis, as well as continued exploitation of resources, uncertain border control, attacks from various armed groups and other problems. In briefings on 27 January and 16 June, UNOCI Head Aichatou Mindaoudou Souleymane detailed what she called significant progress in national dialogue and other areas as well as the causes of continued fragility, including organized crime and a need for intensified security-sector reform.
Libya
10 meetings: 10 March, 14 March, 19 March, 13 May, 9 June, 17 July, 27 August, 15 September, 11 November, 17 December
2 resolutions: 2146, 2174  

The Council intensified its focus on Libya this year as factional fighting involving militias armed during the 2011 overthrow of Muammar al-Qadhafi ramped up and spread throughout the country, causing a governance and humanitarian crisis and prompting the country's representative to call for a stronger international presence. Warnings of impending chaos along with calls for national dialogue to avert it were heard in briefings on 10 March and 9 June from Special Representative Tarek Mitri, head of the United Nations Support Mission for Libya (UNSMIL). Mr. Mitri subsequently reported a sharp escalation of fighting in Tripoli, Benghazi and their international airports, which forced the withdrawal of most UNSMIL staff just prior to his briefing on 17 July. On 15 September a new UNSMIL head, Bernardino Leon, pledged that despite the difficulties, the Mission would remain solidly anchored in unbiased engagement with all parties to try to get the transition to democracy back on track.
In response to the violence in Libya, the Council adopted resolution 2174 (2014) in August calling for an immediate ceasefire, inclusive political dialogue and prior notice of arms transfers. In order to keep sales of the country's resources from further fuelling conflict, the Council adopted resolution 2146 (2014) in March, banning illicit crude exports. On 17 December, the Chair of the Libya sanctions committee described that body's activities to counter the diversion of arms to militias. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, in her semi-annual briefings on 13 May and 11 November, said that the deterioration of security had severely hampered her Office's investigation into human rights crimes that occurred during the uprising against Mr. al-Qadhafi and its aftermath. The violence did not bode well for domestic justice for those in the former regime accused of crimes as well as for those in detention without due process. There were also indications that new serious crimes were being committed in the context of the current fighting, she said, proposing that formation of an international contact group on justice issues in Libya should be explored.
Western Sahara
1 meeting: 29 April
1 resolution: 2152
Reiterating its call upon the parties in Western Sahara and the neighbouring States to cooperate to end the long impasse in reaching a political solution there, the Council extended the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, known as MINURSO, until 30 April 2015, following briefings in consultations by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of MINURSO, Wolfgang Weisbrod-Weber, as well as the Secretary General's Personal Envoy to Western Sahara, Christopher Ross. Through the resolution, the Council also urged donors to provide funding for confidence-building measures and authorized additional United Nations military observers, under the existing budget, to continue monitoring the ceasefire in effect between the parties, Morocco and the Frente Polisario, since 1991 when the Mission was first deployed.
Burundi
5 meetings: 28 January, 13 February, 14 May, 6 August, 5 November
1 resolution: 2137
Council action on Burundi this year was dominated by the drawdown of the United Nations Office in the country, known as BNUB, which was decided on 13 February with the adoption of resolution 2137 (2014). The text also requested the Secretary-General to transfer responsibilities to the Organization's country team by the end of 2014 when BNUB's mandate would be completed. In other meetings on the situation, Special Representative Parfait Onanga-Anyanga underlined the importance of planned 2015 elections and the need to overcome tensions resulting from the boycott of previous polls by opposition parties and continued charges of bias and violence by youth cadres. He stressed the need for continued international support in that light and in the face of development challenges.
Middle East
Question of Palestine
18 meetings: 20 January, 25 February, 18 March, 29 April, 20 May, 23 June, 10 July, 18 July, 22 July, 28 July, 31 July, 18 August, 16 September, 21 October, 29 October, 17 November, 15 December, 30 December
1 presidential statement: 28 July
It had been ""a dramatic year"", Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Robert Serry said of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last monthly briefing on 15 December, noting that hope for renewed negotiations had been eclipsed by increasingly deadly violence in the West Bank and a devastating war in Gaza. In earlier briefings, there were warnings -- first by Secretary-General Ban in January, and then in successive briefings by Mr. Serry and Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman -- that
 

without progress, new cycles of violence could erupt. ""I do not underestimate the difficulties,"" Mr. Ban told the Council ahead of the year's first quarterly debate on the situation on 20 January. ""But the risks of inaction or surrender are far greater,"" he added, noting that peace talks begun last year remained stalled despite strenuous efforts by United States Secretary of State John Kerry to revive them.
With the parties unable to bridge gaps in their substantive positions, Israel suspended its participation in the talks following a 23 April agreement by rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah to form a unity government, Mr. Serry reported just prior to the Council's open debate on 29 April. Israel's delegate said his Government could not negotiate with a partner aligned with a terrorist organization and accused the Palestinians of delaying tactics and of broken commitments with their applications to join 15 international treaties and conventions. The Palestinian Permanent Observer said Israel had undermined the peace process by reneging on a prisoner release agreement and by continuing settlement activities and aggression in East Jerusalem.
On 23 June, Mr. Feltman reported that tensions were ratcheting up after the abduction of three Israeli students; protests and Israeli operations in the West Bank multiplied and increasing numbers of rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza by de facto authority Hamas and other groups, which drew Israeli strikes in response. The cycle of violence was ""spiralling out of control"", the Secretary-General emphasized in an emergency meeting of the Council on 10 July, following a launch by Israel of a military operation, with the stated aim of stopping rocket fire from Gaza. The threat of an Israeli ground offensive loomed after hundreds of projectiles and responses and a mounting death toll. One week later, on 17 July, the operation was indeed expanded to a ground invasion, with the stated aim of destroying Gaza's tunnel system.
The following day, on 18 July, Mr. Feltman called for an urgent ceasefire, attributing the crisis to a collective failure to achieve a political solution. On 31 July, the Head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), Pierre Krahenbuhl, and Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Valerie Amos condemned the destruction and death in Gaza, including at UNRWA schools, while also condemning the placement of weapons found in the Agency's facilities. Israeli ground forces withdrew on 5 August, following which, on 18 August, Mr. Serry told the Council that the death and destruction of this third major escalation in six years was ""appalling"". He again affirmed the need for a lasting solution. On 26 August, an open-ended ceasefire was announced. In all, an estimated 2,200 people had died.
Mr. Ban, following a visit to Gaza, told the Council ahead of an open debate on 21 October that nothing could have prepared him for what he had seen -- ""mile after mile of wholesale destruction"". He called for the $5.4 billion recently pledged for the enclave's reconstruction to materialize quickly, as more than 100,000 residents in Gaza were homeless and more than 50,000 were sheltering in UNRWA-run schools.
Despite initial breaches, the ceasefire held for the rest of the year, although tensions intensified in the West Bank, briefers reported, with the shooting of a Jewish activist and deaths from car attacks on a light rail station, an assault on a synagogue, violent clashes, housing demolitions and vandalism at places of worship, and new settlement planning. A special 29 October briefing by Mr. Feltman was held following Mr. Ban's receipt of letters from the Palestinian Permanent Observer reacting to expanded Israeli settlement plans and restrictions on holy sites in Jerusalem. He and subsequent briefers reiterated calls for a settlement freeze and access to holy sites, along with an end to provocation and inflammatory rhetoric. They noted Israel's assurance that no changes would be made to long-standing cooperative arrangements with Jordan on administering the sites.
The year ended with the 30 December defeat of a long-anticipated draft resolution tabled by Jordan, which would have had Israel withdraw from Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 within three years and required a negotiated solution to the conflict within one year. The draft, failing to win approval by a vote of 8 in favour to 2 against, with 5 abstentions, was described by Israel and those who opposed it -- Australia and the United States -- as a unilateral move that was counterproductive to resuming peace negotiations. The Palestinian Permanent Observer said that Palestinian leadership would now have to consider next steps to end the occupation, adding that Israel must be held to account for its illegal practices.
Syria
13 meetings: 22 February, 22 May, 25 June, 26 June, 14 July, 28 August, 19 September, 30 September, 30 October, 25 November, 15 December, 17 December, 18 December
5 resolutions: 2139, 2163, 2165, 2191, 2192
1 presidential statement: 19 September
The Council focused on the plight of civilians in Syria this year as fighting continued unabated and Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Valerie Amos reported in monthly briefings on what she termed worsening brutality, disregard for human life and ongoing difficulties in delivering humanitarian aid.  

Added to the indiscriminate use of barrel bombs and other weapons, the shelling of populated areas by parties in connection with the Syrian conflict, and siege tactics that deprived people of sustenance was the terror wrought by ISIL and other extremists that widened their hold on large portions of the country, Ms. Amos reported.
A 22 May attempt to hold accountable those committing crimes against civilians in Syria by referring the situation to the International Criminal Court was not adopted owing to vetoes by China and the Russian Federation. Moreover, despite talks between the parties in Geneva in January, the Council noted no progress on a negotiated settlement, although its resolutions affirmed support for new Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, who succeeded Lakhdar Brahimi, and who, towards the end of the year, was seeking a freeze on fighting in embattled urban zones.
The Council did adopt three resolutions to get aid to hard-to-reach areas. Through resolution 2139 (2014) on 22 February, the Council demanded that all parties allow delivery of assistance, cease depriving civilians of food and medicine and enable a voluntary rapid evacuation of civilians in besieged zones. Following a 26 June briefing in which Ms. Amos called the continued obstruction of aid ""inhuman"", the Council adopted resolution 2165 (2014) on 14 July, authorizing for 180 days relief delivery across conflict lines and through additional border crossings. That authorization was extended by resolution 2191 (2014) until 10 January 2016. In briefings following the adoption of resolution 2165 (2014), Ms. Amos said that access to certain areas had improved but the fighting continued to thwart much-needed deliveries, greatly increasing the suffering.
In other action, the Council, on 19 September, condemned attacks against peacekeepers in the area of operations of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), which monitors the truce between Syrian and Israeli forces in the Golan Heights, demanding that all groups, including the Al-Nusra Front, abandon all UNDOF positions and return the Force's equipment, including vehicles and weapons. The mandate of UNDOF was renewed twice, by resolution 2163 (2014) in June and resolution 2192 (2014) in December, extending it until 30 June 2015, strongly condemning the recent heavy fighting in the area of separation.
Following up implementation of resolution 2118 (2013), in which the Council expressed outrage at the use of chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 in a Damascus suburb, Sigrid Kaag, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General and former Special Coordinator of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)-United Nations Joint Mission to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons, briefed Council members throughout 2014 in consultations on implementation of that text, which prohibits Syria from using, developing, producing, otherwise acquiring, stockpiling or retaining chemical weapons and requires it to provide ""immediate and unfettered"" access by the OPCW to any and all chemical weapons sites.
Iraq
6 meetings: 10 January, 27 March, 23 July, 30 July, 19 September, 18 November
1 resolution: 2169
2 presidential statements: 10 January, 19 September
As Islamic militants continued to seize strategic areas throughout Iraq, the Council's attention in 2014 focused on ways to extinguish the threat posed by the ISIL -- on which it passed several resolutions -- and support the new Government formed amid its bloody ascendance.
In a September meeting chaired by United States Secretary of State John Kerry, the Council, in a statement, expressed deep outrage that Iraqis and nationals of other States had been killed, kidnapped, raped and tortured by ISIL. It urged support for the new unity Government -- approved by Parliament on 8 September -in its fight against ISIL and associated armed groups. Some 1.8 million Iraqis had been displaced since January, Nickolay Mladenov, the Secretary-General's Special Representative for Iraq, told the meeting.
The call for support echoed a presidential statement, issued in January, in which the Council condemned ISIL attempts to destabilize Iraq, deploring recent events in Ramadi and Fallujah, in Anbar Province. In quarterly briefings, the Special Representative called the Anbar crisis the most serious challenge to the very stability needed to rebuild a democratic Iraq, stressing in March that it was impacting other parts of the country. By July, he warned: ""From a splinter group of Al-Qaida, ISIL today has grown to be a complex threat to peace and security in Iraq, the entire region and beyond,"" prompting the Council a week later to renew until 31 July 2015 the mandate of United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), which Mr. Mladenov also heads. By year-end, he urged continued support for the unity Government's efforts, saying they were showing signs of success in countering the brutal onslaught by terrorist forces.
Yemen
 

4 meetings: 14 May, 26 February, 29 August, 11 December
1 resolution: 2140
1 presidential statement: 29 August
Under its agenda item on the situation in the Middle East, the Council this year continued to receive bimonthly briefings in consultations from Special Adviser Jamal Benomar on the progress and threats in the transition towards inclusive democracy in Yemen. In February, through resolution 2140 (2014), it welcomed the holding of the National Dialogue Conference for that purpose, but at the same time, expressed concern over human rights abuses in the country and condemned the growing number of attacks sponsored by Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.
Through the resolution, in an effort to counter such threats to the transition, the Council imposed travel bans and other targeted measures on those who endangered the country's stability. It also created a committee, now referred to as the 2140 Committee, to monitor implementation of the measures. The body's Chair, Raimonda MurmokaitA- of Lithuania, said in an open briefing on 11 December that the group had so far designated three individuals as subject to the targeted sanctions and urged all States to implement the sanctions regime. Responding to other threats in an August presidential statement, the Council called on the Houthi Shi'a faction, who ringed the capital of Sana'a with checkpoints and eventually captured it, to withdraw its forces.
Lebanon
2 meetings: 29 May, 26 August
1 resolution: 2172
1 presidential statement: 29 May
Calling on all Lebanese parties to refrain from any involvement in the Syrian crisis as the country continued to host hundreds of thousands of refugees and sustain border attacks, the Council, in a May presidential statement, expressed concern that the election of a new President did not take place within the constitution time frame. It urged the parties to preserve national unity in the face of attempts to undermine the country's stability. In this year's renewal of the mandate of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), the Council welcomed strategic dialogue between the Mission and Lebanese Armed Forces and stressed the importance of ensuring the security of the Force, established to monitor the blue line between Israeli and Lebanese militaries. UNIFIL was extended until 31 August 2015, with no major changes in deployment.
Asia
Afghanistan
5 meetings: 17 March, 25 June, 18 September, 12 December, 18 December
2 resolutions: 2145, 2189
2 presidential statements: 25 June (1), 25 June (2)
The full assumption of Afghan security leadership in the central Asian country, still beset by near-daily Taliban attacks on troops, police and civilians, as well as the protracted deadlock over the results of the 5 April presidential election, dominated Council considerations on Afghanistan this year. In the country's first attempt at a democratic transfer of power, two candidates claimed victory in the first round. By the first of two presidential statements issued on 25 June, the Council welcomed the holding of a second electoral round and called on political entities to work together to strengthen national unity. In the second, it expressed concern at the increase in poppy production.
""There is quite simply no better way forward other than a Government of national unity led by an elected President,"" Jan Kubis, the Secretary-General's Special Representative and head of United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), told the Council on 18 September, just days before rival candidates Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani signed a power-sharing deal. Two months later, in a 18 December briefing, Nicholas Haysom, who had replaced Mr. Kubis on 25 September, said he had been ""greatly encouraged"" by the peaceful political transition. He urged leaders to appoint a merit-based Cabinet and launch their ""ambitious"" new governance reforms, while expressing serious concern at ongoing violence, with the number of civilian deaths and injuries this year superseding any other since 2008.
As the 31 December end of the authorization for the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) neared, the Council, through resolution 2189 (2014) adopted on 12 December, welcomed the agreement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Afghan Government to establish a post-2014 non-combat  

mission in the country, known as the Resolute Support Mission (RSM), to train and assist national security forces. Earlier in the year, the Council had extended UNAMA's mandate until 17 March 2015.
Democratic People's Republic of Korea
1 meeting: 22 December
On 22 December, the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea became an agenda item under the country's name itself after a letter was sent to the Council President by 10 members expressing concern about the ""scale and gravity of human rights violations"" described in the report of the Commission of Inquiry established by the Human Rights Council (document S/2014/276) and its impact on international peace and security. The report had been submitted to the Council by the General Assembly through a resolution adopted on 18 December, which encouraged the 15-member body to refer the situation to the International Criminal Court. China and the Russian Federation voted against including the agenda item, stating that domestic human rights issues were not a reason for that move, but were overruled by a procedural vote (not subject to veto) of 11 in favour, with 2 abstentions (Chad, Nigeria).
In the resulting meeting, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan SimonoviA recounted the systematic use of murder, extermination, disappearances, enslavement and rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence cited in the Commission's report as tools of political repression in the country, adding: ""If we are to reduce tension in the region, there must be movement towards real respect for human rights in the DPRK. This is deserving of the Security Council's fullest attention and action."" Some Council members called for referral to the International Criminal Court or other action, but consideration was not scheduled.
Europe
Ukraine
19 meetings: 1 March, 3 March, 13 March, 15 March, 19 March, 13 April, 16 April, 29 April, 2 May, 28 May, 24 June, 18 July, 21 July, 5 August, 8 August, 28 August, 19 September, 24 October, 12 November
1 resolution: 2166
In the lead-up to the Russian annexation of Crimea and the continuing violent standoff between separatists and national forces in the east, the crisis in Ukraine quickly emerged as a major new concern of the Council in March, following months of mass protests in Kyiv that culminated in February violence that left more than 100 dead and pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych ousted. With the Council sharply divided throughout the year, it was able to successfully act on only one resolution -- calling for an investigation of the downing of a Malaysian airliner over eastern Ukraine in July.
Ukraine's representative appealed to the Council to do everything possible to prevent Russian military intervention in a 1 March emergency meeting called after the Russian Parliament approved the use of force on Ukrainian territory. In a meeting two days later, Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Oscar Fernandez-Taranco described United Nations diplomatic efforts to head off the crisis, as Ukraine's representative said tens of thousands of Russian troops had crossed the border. The Russian representative denied that, although he said what he called Ukraine's takeover by radical extremists was breeding serious risks and his country was concerned about the rights of minorities.
On 13 March, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman said a peaceful solution was still possible, while some Council members warned that a referendum in Crimea on joining the Russian Federation, planned for 16 March, was a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty. On 15 March, the Russian Federation vetoed a draft text that would have denied the validity of that referendum; China abstained. On 19 March, following the holding of the poll and the takeover of Ukrainian military bases, Assistant-Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan SimonoviA and Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson voiced grave concern over chronic rights violations and noted the deployment by the United Nations of a human rights monitoring mission, which would coordinate with the OSCE.
On 13 April, Mr. Fernandez-Taranco said separatist groups and unidentified armed individuals had begun to seize Government buildings and confiscate weapons in the eastern Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk region. ""At this moment, Ukraine teeters on the very brink,"" he said, as the Ukraine representative continued to assert that Russian troops were backing the separatists and the Russian representative countered that the Kyiv authorities were taking ""terrible actions"" in the area. On 16 April, Mr. SimonoviA said that protest-related rights violations must be urgently investigated and security forces must maintain public order in accordance with human rights standards.
An ""emerging spirit of compromise"" in a 17 April joint Geneva statement by the parties quickly evaporated as the violence in the east escalated, Mr. Feltman said in a 29 April briefing, as he described militia groups taking control of more facilities and territory, the detention of monitors from the OSCE and reports of torture
 

and kidnappings. Three days later, Mr. Feltman, in another update, reported on further clashes and the shooting down of two Ukrainian helicopters, while calling for a diplomatic solution. The violence continued despite hope for a ""new chapter"" in Ukraine after May presidential elections garnered wide participation, Mr. Feltman said on 28 May. He called for international support of a united, stable Ukraine in that meeting and on 24 June, after a unilateral ceasefire was put in place by national authorities.
That initiative began to dissolve and the Council was soon seized by the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH 17 on 17 July over a separatist-held area. The next day, speakers in the Council expressed outrage, as well as condolences, for the nearly 300 lives lost, and called for an immediate investigation. Three days later, resolution 2166 (2014) demanded accountability, full access to the site and a halt to military activities in the area, with speakers, in statements after the vote, expressing disgust over reported mistreatment of bodies and evidence tampering by separatist groups. The Russian representative warned about jumping to conclusions about the culpability of those groups, while he posed questions to Ukrainian air traffic authorities. Early results of the investigation showed that the jet was hit by ""high-energy objects"", Mr. Feltman said in a follow-up on 19 September, which also heard about continuing investigations from Foreign Minister Frans Timmermans of the Netherlands, whose country lost the largest number of citizens in the incident.
The humanitarian toll of the crisis was the focus of briefings on 5 August by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs' John Ging and on 8 August by Mr. SimonoviA, who said that hostilities had escalated since the end of a formal ceasefire amid rapid professionalization of armed groups, with their leadership including Russian citizens and their ranks equipped with heavy weapons. Both briefers reported many civilian casualties, with fighting in population centres and human rights violations in the east. Mr. Feltman, briefing on 28 August, described a dangerous new wave of escalation, with armed groups seizing more area and ""deeply alarming reports of Russian military involvement"".
Hope for an end to the crisis was seen with the 5 September signing of the Minsk Protocol for a ceasefire and Government reforms, with a follow-up 19 September memorandum clarifying ceasefire issues. In a 24 October briefing, however, Mr. Fernandez-Taranco reported that, while steps had been taken by the Ukrainian Government towards decentralization, daily violations of the ceasefire occurred. He called for its full implementation along with support to the related OSCE monitoring mission, while Mr. SimonoviA reported that the death toll had risen to at least 3,724 from the crisis and that armed groups continued to terrorize the population in areas under their control, with enforced disappearance in Crimea a worrying new trend.
In the final briefing of the year, on 12 November, Mr. Toyberg-Frandzen reported that fighting had again escalated and an OSCE official said that monitors had observed large convoys of heavy weapons and troops flowing into rebel-held areas. Briefers and most Council members called for implementation of the Minsk agreements, amid sharp exchanges between the Russian representative and others on Russian support for the separatists.
Bosnia and Herzegovina
3 meetings: 15 May, 11 November (1), 11 November (2)
1 resolution: 2183
In the first Council meeting on Bosnia and Herzegovina this year, the High Representative for Implementation of the Peace Agreement again described obstacles to progress in the country, including divisive rhetoric from leaders of the Republika Srpska, which promoted a separatist agenda by exploiting events in Ukraine. However, after successful elections on 12 October, the High Representative said that the new leadership had a fresh opportunity to set the nation on a better track. Though catastrophic floods had affected nearly 1 million people, the country had come together, he said, adding that urgent steps, however, were still needed to overhaul the business environment, enforce law and order, and implement the Constitutional Court's verdicts. Earlier that day, the Council renewed authorization of the European Union-led multinational stabilization force, EUFOR ALTHEA, for another 12 months, with the Russian Federation abstaining from the vote due to language in the text on European integration.
Kosovo
4 meetings: 10 February, 27 May, 29 August, 4 December
The Council's attention on Kosovo this year was again focused on normalization of relations in the region, dialogue between parties and pragmatic steps to ease tensions. In his briefings, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Farid Zarif, stressed that the success of the first general elections held under a unified framework, on 8 June, should lead to the formation of a new government. Mr. Zarif, who is also the Head of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), urged political leaders in Kosovo to treat that task as ""the most pressing imperative"". As the First Agreement on Principles Governing the Normalization of Relations of 19 April 2013 entered its second year, both sides had to embrace
 

forward-looking approaches to sensitive issues, among them, the establishment of an association/community of Serbian municipalities in Kosovo, Mr. Zarif said.
Towards year end, on 4 December, Mr. Zarif called for the resumption of high-level meetings between Pristina and Belgrade to advance the normalization process. He said that the political deadlock in establishing a new Assembly of Kosovo could thwart opportunities presented by ""stabilization and association"" talks with the European Union. Hashim Thaci of Kosovo said it was time for the Security Council to consider transforming UNMIK into a political office aimed at helping Kosovo join the community of free nations. Maintaining the opposite view on that topic, Serbia's Prime Minister, Ivica DaAiA, stressed the importance of progress in establishing a community of Serbian municipalities in Kosovo and Metohija, while acknowledging that important agreements on energy and telecommunications had been reached.
Cyprus
2 meetings: 30 January, 30 July
2 resolutions: 2135, 2168
In this year's resolutions to extend the mandate of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), which has been deployed since 1964 when inter-communal fighting divided the island, the Council again called for more steps towards reaching a settlement between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sides, including greater progress in United Nations-backed talks, military confidence-building measures and the opening of more crossing points on the Green Line. In the latest renewal, UNFICYP's mandate was extended until 31 July 2015.
Americas
Haiti
3 meetings: 24 March, 11 September, 14 October
1 resolution: 2180
The Council focused on adjusting the mandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) as it continued to assist with capacity-building in security and to step back from other tasks it had taken on after the 2010 earthquake. It authorized a one-year extension of the Mission's mandate on 14 October, deciding on a drawdown of troop levels to 2,370 by June 2015, with police personnel at the level of 2,601. The resolution, however, called on the Mission to maintain appropriate capacity to ""act at any time"", and addressed prevailing political tensions by urging Haiti's political actors to hold the postponed national elections without delay. Those issues were also the subject of discussions in the previous two meetings on Haiti during 2014.
Non-Proliferation
Iran
5 meetings: 20 March, 9 June, 25 June, 15 September, 18 December
1 resolution: 2159
In quarterly briefings throughout the year with the Chair of the sanctions committee established by resolution 1737 (2006) under the agenda item Non-proliferation, speakers expressed hope that assurances of the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme and full cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would result from ongoing talks between the country and the P5+1 group (China, France, Russian Federation, United States, and the United Kingdom plus Germany). At the same time, most stressed that until an agreement was reached, it was critical for all Member States to comply with the measures in place. In that context, the Chair continued to report on cooperation and violations, including possible procurement of prohibited carbon fibre and the exportation of arms by a ship intercepted in the Red Sea in April carrying rockets and other conventional weapons. By the December briefing, Iran had not responded to the Committee letter concerning the two incidents. On 9 June, through resolution 2159 (2014), the Council extended the mandate of the Panel of Experts assisting the 1737 Committee until 9 July 2015.
Democratic People's Republic of Korea
1 meeting: 5 March
1 resolution: 2141
 

For most of the year, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was considered by the Council under the agenda item of Non-Proliferation, because of its decades-long programme to develop nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. In that context, amid the country's continuing test launches of short- and medium-range missiles early in the year, which were discussed in consultations, the Council renewed for 13 months until 5 April 2015 the mandate of the Panel of Experts assisting the 1718 Committee on sanctions imposed on the country.
1540 Committee
2 meetings: 7 May, 24 November
1 presidential statement: 7 May
Marking a decade since its landmark adoption of resolution 1540 (2004) on non-proliferation, the Council on 7 May issued a statement reaffirming the need to prevent non-State actors from gaining access to nuclear, chemical and biological materials or financing needed to acquire them. The related 1540 Committee was urged to coordinate its activities with other international, regional and subregional organizations. In a briefing on 24 November, the Chair of the 1540 Committee said high priority over the past six months had been given to encouraging reporting on national efforts to implement the resolution.
Threats to International Peace and Security
Terrorism
7 meetings: 27 January, 17 June, 28 July, 15 August, 24 September, 19 November, 19 December
6 resolutions: 2133, 2160, 2161, 2170, 2178, 2195
2 presidential statements: 28 July, 19 November
The Council intensified its action on terrorism this year, with five of seven public meetings focused on disrupting the brutal campaign to establish a caliphate across the Middle East by ISIL. In a 19 November high-level debate, which heard from more than 60 speakers, the Council expressed its serious concern that more than 15,000 foreign terrorist fighters from more than 80 countries had travelled to join ISIL, Al-Nusra Front and other groups in Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen, as well as Maghreb and Sahel countries. The Chair of the Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee, briefing the meeting, said most of ISIL's funds came from its control of oil fields and oil smuggling, with the Secretary-General adding that programmes had been stepped up for reporting, monitoring and assisting States in countering violent propaganda.
The debate built on earlier momentum, notably the 24 September adoption of resolution 2178 (2014), by which the Council decided that States should prevent the ""recruiting, organizing, transporting or equipping"" of those who travelled outside their State of residence or nationality to perpetrate, plan or participate in terrorist acts, with a focus on ISIL, Al-Nusra Front and Al-Qaida splinter groups. A 28 July statement reminded States to ensure that no one on their territory engaged in commercial or financial activities that benefitted those extremists, and that such engagement could lead to sanctions listings. Resolution 2170 (2014), adopted on 15 August, condemned gross, systematic and widespread human rights abuse by the groups and named individuals subject to travel restrictions, asset freezes and other measures, while resolution 2133 (2014), adopted on 27 January, called on States to prevent terrorists from benefiting from ransom payments or political concessions.
The Council capped its consideration of terrorism with the 19 December adoption of resolution 2195 (2014) during a day-long debate on terrorism and cross-border crime, which heard from 50 speakers. By the text, the Council noted that terrorists profited from the trafficking of arms, persons, drugs, and artefacts, and from the illicit trade in natural resources, including gold and other precious metals, minerals, wildlife, charcoal and oil, as well as from kidnapping, extortion and bank robbery.
On the sanctions front, the Council on 25 November heard from the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs that the 15 United Nations sanctions regimes, while valuable, had to be improved through missions to assess their impact and expanded designation criteria to address specific human rights violations. On 17 June, the Council passed resolutions 2160 (2014) and 2161 (2014), respectively urging States to freeze the funds and financial assets of individuals and entities affiliated with the Taliban and extending the mandate of the Office of the Ombudsperson established by resolution 1904 (2009) to monitor the Al-Qaida Consolidated List for 30 months from the current June 2015 expiration date.
In numerous press statements condemning individual terrorist acts, the Council reiterated that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations was criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of its motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed, and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group.
 

Subsidiary Bodies
2 meetings: 28 May, 9 December
On 28 May, the Council heard briefings by the Chairs of the Committees forming a crucial part of the United Nations counter-terrorism machinery: the Committee established pursuant to resolution 1373 (2001), also known as the Counter-Terrorism Committee; the Committee established pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011) concerning Al-Qaida; and the 1540 Committee concerning the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Delivering a joint statement, Lithuania's representative said the committees and their expert groups would continue to explore ways to strengthen their coordination and boost national implementation of the regimes.
The meeting dovetailed with another on 9 December, which featured briefings by the five outgoing Council members on the work of the subsidiary bodies they had chaired during their two-year tenure: the 751/1907 Somalia-Eritrea Sanctions Committee and the ""1540 Committee"" (Republic of Korea); the 1267/1989 Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee, the Iran Sanctions Committee and the 1988 Taliban Sanctions Committee (Australia); the 1591 Sudan Sanctions Committee and the Informal Working Group on Documentation and Other Procedural Questions (Argentina); the 1718 Democratic People's Republic of Korea Sanctions Committee and the Working Group on Children and Armed Conflict (Luxembourg); and the 1970 Libya Sanctions Committee and the Working Group on Peacekeeping Operations (Rwanda).
International Justice
International Criminal Tribunals
3 meetings: 5 June, 10 December, 18 December
2 resolutions: 2193, 2194
As in previous years, the Council was updated twice on progress by the presidents and prosecutors of the International Tribunals for serious human rights crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. All Tribunal officials stressed the need for continued support as they strove to complete their casework and to hand over unfinished business and records to the Residual Mechanism.
It was warned that not all cases and appeals would be finished by the end of 2014, and on 18 December the Security Council adopted resolution 2194 (2014), extending the terms of judges of both courts, with four judges on the Rwanda court and 16 permanent judges of the court for the former Yugoslavia extended to 31 December 2015 or until the completion of the cases to which they were assigned, whichever was sooner. The terms of two judges on the Rwanda court were extended to 31 July 2015 under the same conditions. As in years past, the Russian Federation abstained from the vote on resolution 2193 (2014) on the Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, objecting to further extensions, citing inefficiency and lack of planning on the part of the court.
International Court of Justice
9 meetings: 6 November, 7 November, 17 November
Over the course of 9 separate meetings, the Council -- meeting independently from but concurrently with the General Assembly -- elected five judges to the International Court of Justice for nine-year terms, beginning on 6 February 2015, filling vacancies that would arise from the expiration of terms of members. Under the Court's Statute, a candidate must obtain an absolute majority in both bodies to be elected.
On 6 November, after four rounds of voting, the Council re-elected Mohamed Bennouna (Morocco) and Joan E. Donoghue (United States) to their seats and elected James Richard Crawford (Australia) and Kirill Gevorgian (Russian Federation). Patrick Lipton Robinson (Jamaica) was elected in one round on 17 November, following a marathon run-off on 7 November with Susana Ruiz Cerutti (Argentina), which had seen seven rounds of voting.
Rule of Law
2 meetings: 19 February, 21 February
1 presidential statement: 21 February
The Security Council capped the second of two meetings on the topic with a 21 February presidential statement describing the promotion of justice and the rule of law as ""indispensable"" for peaceful coexistence and the prevention of armed conflict. Support provided by peacekeeping and special political missions to the host country was important for the strengthening of rule-of-law institutions, the Council stated, outlining activities that could form part of such work.  

Speaking in an open debate on 19 February, which explored the link between strong public institutions and conflict prevention, the Secretary-General said the crafting of peacekeeping and peacebuilding mandates offered a ""strategic opportunity"" to support national rule-of-law priorities. ""People must be able to trust that their institutions can resolve disputes promptly and fairly,"" he said.
Cooperation with Regional Organizations
African Union
1 meeting: 16 December
1 presidential statement: 16 December
Through a 16 December presidential statement, which preceded an open debate that heard from some 40 speakers, Council members highlighted the need for stronger and more cohesive cooperation between the body and the African Union in matters of peace and security on the continent, as well as in areas of conflict prevention and resolution, rapid response to emerging crises and protection of civilians, particularly women and children. The statement welcomed the operationalization of both the African Standby Force and the Rapid Deployment Force. ""The time has come for us to take our partnership to a new level of clarity, practicality and predictability,"" the Secretary-General said at the start of the meeting.
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
1 meeting: 24 February
This year's briefing by the Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) focused on the group's efforts to address the crisis in Ukraine, including the dispatching of a needs assessment team to that country, the appointment of a personal envoy and a proposed international contact group. The OSCE's other work, the Chairperson said, included support for 57 States, for elections from Afghanistan to northern Kosovo, and for other security partnerships, an increasing number of which were in Asia and the Mediterranean.
European Union
1 meeting: 14 February
1 presidential statement: 14 February
The Council this year issued its first ever presidential statement on cooperation between the United Nations and the European Union, commending the bloc's involvement in international negotiation and mediation processes, and its commitment to peacekeeping, peacebuilding, humanitarian assistance and financial and logistical support. It called attention, in particular, to the Union's aid to Syria and its provision of in-kind support for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)-United Nations Joint Mission to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons. Making statements before the Council were the Secretary-General, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of the European Union, and other representatives.
Thematic Debates
Peacekeeping Operations
4 meetings: 11 June, 28 July, 9 October, 20 November
2 resolutions: 2167, 2185
The Security Council addressed its traditional peacekeeping agenda item four times this year, perhaps most notably on 20 November with the adoption of its first-ever stand-alone resolution on policing mandates, which it resolved to make an integral part of peacekeeping and special political missions, where appropriate. Policing mandates must be clear, credible and achievable, the Council stressed, and matched by appropriate resources. It called on police contributors and the Secretary-General to ensure professionalism through proper training, equipping, standards, leadership, gender expertise and a range of other means. The Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations and three United Nations Police Commissioners briefed the Council prior to the adoption of resolution 2185 (2014).
Earlier in the year, the Council adopted resolution 2167 (2014) on 28 July, encouraging the United Nations and regional organizations to develop more effective partnerships, which the Secretary-General, who briefed the meeting, said should be based on each group's comparative strengths. More broadly, on 11 June, delegates wrestled with the potentially injurious implications of ""robust"" peacekeeping mandates during a day-long debate in which they weighed the merits of unmanned aerial vehicles and other technologies. Force  

Commanders briefing on 9 October agreed that swift adaptation to ever more perilous environments was critical to protecting peacekeepers and civilians under their mandate.
Post-Conflict Peacebuilding
2 meetings: 19 March, 15 July
In two meetings on post-conflict peacebuilding, the Council heard calls to strengthen - and fully use - the Peacebuilding Commission, one of the United Nations' most effective tools for helping countries recover from conflict. The Deputy Secretary-General, opening a 19 March debate, urged taking advantage of next year's review of the advisory body to make it more ""relevant, catalytic and effective"". Reliable, early funding by the Peacebuilding Fund of cantonment -- a key confidence-building step in the peace process -- was vital.
Echoing those remarks, the Commission Chair, presenting the body's report on 15 July, said recent crises in the Central African Republic and South Sudan were painful reminders that efforts to prevent relapse into conflict remained insufficient. National ownership was a key political principle, as was regional engagement. Other crucial components were programmatic interventions centred on institution-building and improved interaction with the Security Council.
Women, Peace and Security
2 meetings: 25 April, 28 October
1 presidential statement: 28 October
Ending the second of two meetings on women, peace and security with a presidential statement, the Council, on 28 October, urged States to bolster protection for and empowerment of displaced women and girls, particularly in light of increasing threats to them posed by terrorist groups. Refugee and internally displaced women and girls were at heightened risk of abuse, it said, urging that their access to justice, humanitarian assistance and basic services -- including for sexual and reproductive health -- be strengthened.
In a day-long open debate on 25 April, the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict described ""heart breaking"" meetings with wartime sexual violence survivors, calling the horrors they had suffered a ""great moral issue of our time"". The Secretary-General recalled that combating conflict-related sexual abuse was a Council priority, as it was as destructive as any bomb or bullet.
Children and Armed Conflict
2 meetings: 7 March, 8 September
1 resolution: 2143
The Council held two open debates on children and armed conflict, the first of which -- on 7 March -culminated in the unanimous adoption of resolution 2143 (2014), condemning all international legal violations applicable to the recruitment and use of children by parties to armed conflict. States were called on to facilitate the development and implementation of action plans to eradicate such behaviour. ""All children deserve and are entitled to protection,"" the Secretary-General said, opening the meeting. Other presentations were made by the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict, the Executive Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and a former child soldier from Sierra Leone.
In an open debate on 8 September, more than 60 speakers urged accelerated action to prevent -- and ensure accountability for -- the killing, recruitment and other abuse of children in situations of armed conflict. Delegates cited the Secretary-General's latest report on the issue (S/2014/339), which listed 8 countries and 51 non-State actors -- including, for the first time, the Nigerian militia Boko Haram -- that recruited, killed, maimed or sexually abused children, or engaged in attacks on schools and hospitals. ""Acknowledgement is not enough,"" said a survivor of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. ""You must take action for the nightmares to stop.""
Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict
3 meetings: 12 February, 19 August, 29 August
1 resolution: 2175
1 presidential statement: 12 February
In the first of three meetings, the Security Council stressed the importance of engagement by senior mission leadership in ensuring all levels of the chain of command were involved in the civilian protection mandate, according to a presidential statement issued during a 12 February open debate, which counted United  

Nations human rights and peacekeeping experts among its 62 speakers. The Council had taken crucial decisions, delegates recalled, to equip peacekeeping missions with ""robust"" protection mandates, with positive results seen in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mali. Later, on 29 August, the Council adopted resolution 2175 (2014), strongly condemning the violence and intimidation to which humanitarian workers in conflict situations were increasingly exposed and laying out several steps it intended to take to ensure their protection. Among them, the Council requested the Secretary-General to include relevant parts of the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel in existing agreements with host countries. In remarks on 19 August - World Humanitarian Day the Deputy Secretary-General pressed the 15-member body to further encourage parties to comply with international legal obligations and impose targeted measures on grave violators. Other Matters Working Methods 6 meetings: 30 July, 28 August, 23 October, 30 October, 26 November, 22 December On 30 July, under Rwanda's presidency, the Security Council held its first ""wrap-up session"" in a public briefing format since 2005, offering a glimpse into the ongoing internal debate on working methods. In other public wrap-up sessions that followed, Member States exchanged views on situations addressed each month, covering Gaza, Israel, Palestine, Syria, Ukraine and a range of events in Africa, as well as the body's approach to emerging - or worsening -- peacekeeping challenges. Interventions also focused on the themes of sanctions, policing, terrorism and Ebola. Four other wrap-up sessions were held in a closed format. The Council's annual discussion of working methods, on 23 October, heard briefings by the Ombudsperson and Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, both of whom laid out ways the 15-member body could enhance its interaction with their institutions. Annual Report 1 meeting: 22 October During the Council's meeting to adopt its annual report to the General Assembly for the period 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2014, the representative of Rwanda, central to formulating the text's introduction, said the way in which the section had been drafted was a model of consensus for the Council. The text provided a thematic context for the 238 formal meetings of the body in 2014, of which 218 had been public, resulting in 55 resolutions as presented in the report. Following those remarks, the Council unanimously adopted the report.","Growing Global Threats Compel Security Council in 2014 to Deploy or Reconfigure Peace Missions, Bolster Anti-Terrorism Effort, Scrutinize Working Methods [document]",All Africa AFNWS English

Jan 21, 2015 (United Nations/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Note: A complete summary of today's Security Council meeting will be made available after its conclusion.
BAN KI-MOON, Secretary-General of the United Nations, stressed the importance of integrating the three pillars of United Nations concerns: peace and security, development and human rights. ""We must break out of our silos and work together on all three areas simultaneously,"" he said, noting that in negotiations on the post-2015 sustainable development agenda, much attention had been paid to all three areas. ""We now have an important opportunity to broaden the development agenda and highlight the fundamental importance of inclusive societies in building a more peaceful world,"" he said. ""Development that excludes part of the population can be socially corrosive. It can contribute to crime and create a sense of hopelessness and alienation,"" he added. Women and migrants and those without social safety nets were especially vulnerable to the results.
""Post-conflict societies must prioritize social, economic and political inclusion if they are to have any hope of rebuilding trust between communities,"" he said, stressing that gender equality and women's empowerment were key to reconciliation and reconstruction. Even in countries at peace, inclusive development would not happen by accident; Governments, the private sector and civil society must demonstrate their commitment to education, health, job creation and other crucial elements. Governance and political representation were also critical determinants, as people needed effective channels for addressing their concerns. He affirmed the readiness of the United Nations to increase its support to countries in promoting inclusive development, noting that the Peacebuilding Commission was undergoing a review of how to make that support more robust and flexible.
ANTONIO DE AGUIAR PATRIOTA (Brazil), Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission, said that inclusion was a central aspect of peacebuilding and political exclusion was often a key factor behind the relapse into violent conflict. Political exclusion was particularly dangerous when it coincided with other forms of inequality, along with social, cultural, judicial or economic lines. The mutually reinforcing nature of development, peace and security and human rights was well recognized and central to the thinking behind the creation of the Peacebuilding Commission. Recognizing the interdependency between those distinct approaches did not suggest that the Council should take on responsibilities regarding development matters. The General Assembly, Economic and Social Council and the Commission were in a better position to explore those issues in conjunction with United Nations-mandated development organizations.
He then highlighted a few cases where the Commission had contributed to more inclusive societies. In Burundi, it last year worked closely with Government authorities, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and the United Nations country team to promote a more inclusive political environment. Despite concerns about some isolated security incidents involving youth wings of political parties, those efforts had promoted greater trust between the Government, political parties and civil society. He went on to cite successful examples of inclusive development in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
It was important to focus attention on an inclusive political process that would reinforce national ownership, rebuild the fabric of fractured societies and establish a new social contract, he said. ""This should be the cornerstone of our collective efforts aimed at building lasting peace in countries emerging from conflict."" As the General Assembly and the Security Council prepared to conduct the 10-year review of the peacebuilding architecture this year, there was a need to ensure that the United Nations response would live up to the aspirations of millions of people in countries emerging from conflict.
LEYMAH GBOWEE, Nobel Laureate and President of the Gbowee Peace Foundation Africa, related the experience of the women of the Liberia Mass Action for Peace, who came together from different ethnic groups 14 years into the civil war ""to achieve peace in a nation that had been ravaged by war"". It was clear, she said, that greed would constantly override the need for peace and women had been prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice by using non-violent tactics and dialogue to promote a negotiated settlement.
 

There is a peace now in Liberia, she said, but worldwide there is a sense of deep fear, with freedom of worship, freedom of expression, girls' access to education and their autonomy over their own bodies, and many other things that made life meaningful under threat. ""If this is what international peace and security that should be maintained looks like, I would rather live in war and strive to achieve peace,"" she stressed. From Liberian women, the lesson could be learned that the spirit of unity was crucial. Today, however, there was division when there should be consensus. ""Exclusivity is the order of the day even in the process of attaining peace and security,"" she said.
Not only did women continue to be left out of peace processes, the Council was exclusive as well, she said. ""Seventy years ago, the rationale to name five permanent members made sense since many countries in this room were colonized by one of those permanent members,"" she recalled. As the world had changed, it was time to change some of the systems and structures that made it impossible to achieve international peace and security.
MICHELLE BACHELET JERIA, President of Chile and Council President for the month of January, speaking in her national capacity, observed that the large-scale inter-State warlike confrontations common in the twentieth century were not occurring in present times. However, the so-called ""traditional threats to security"" had largely been replaced by ""new threats"" of a non-State and non-military nature, including, among others, intranational wars, terrorism, drug trafficking, arms trade, trafficking in persons and the deterioration of the environment. A multidimensional approach must be adopted that addressed the underlying causes, such as gender, ethnic, tribal, religious and socioeconomic matters. ""This is the only way in which we can effectively contribute to conflict prevention and peacebuilding in the world,"" she stated.
Echoing the Secretary-General's statement that the biggest threat to terrorists was not ""the power of missiles"", but the politics of inclusion, including education and jobs, she said that Chile was focusing on narrowing social gaps and preventing segments of the population from being left behind. Although her country had ""a long way to go"", she said that in many countries the distance between the reality and that ideal of inclusion was huge and did not appear to be lessening over time. Latin America, the region with the most inequality, also had the highest homicide rate and was most affected by drug trafficking and organized crime. Providing an overview of recent events in the Middle East, Africa and Western Europe, she pointed out that, in contrast, the example of Liberia showed that when processes were inclusive they were more likely to be successful. National reconsolidation and peacebuilding had been achieved through mechanisms for inclusion of all concerned sectors, where women, in particular peace activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Leymah Gbowee, played an outstanding role. Inclusive development was of vital importance towards a more peaceful, safe and fair world for all.
SAMANTHA POWER (United States) said that as threats to international peace and security evolved, so did the conception of those in the Council. One of the main reasons for the quick spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa was the acute underdevelopment of the public health system. There was a connection between such threats as Ebola and violence because extremists thrive in places of underdevelopment. Describing the enormous cost of those threats to development, she said that one place to start was women and girls. In Liberia, women formed a non-violent grassroots movement, which led to a peace agreement between the Government and rebels. In Afghanistan, her Government helped women and girls integrate into society. Now, the rate of women serving in Parliament was higher in Afghanistan than in the United States. Her country had invested heavily in the post-2015 development agenda, which should leave no one behind in both developing and developed countries. Her delegation attached special importance to Goal 16, which related to inclusiveness. Inequality was an enduring obstacle to American prosperity. Many gaps still existed in the United States and in the world.
MANUEL DOMINGOS AUGUSTO, Secretary of State for External Relations of Angola, stressed the importance of national inclusion. States must address problems of ethnicity with particular sensitivity to prevent exclusion and promote full coexistence and equal opportunities. For social inclusion, gender issues must be streamlined in national policymaking. Economic inclusion was crucial for the effective participation of all individuals, and cultural inclusion was vital for social and national cohesion. A post-conflict nation, Angola's peacemaking processes were consistent with the principles of inclusion. Since 2002, the Government had conducted a broad socioeconomic integration programme for marginalized segments of the population during armed conflict, especially for ex-combatants and their families. Government social inclusion policies focused on the empowerment of women as a way to create a society of free, responsible citizens. Angola had proclaimed 2015 the ""Year of the Rural Woman"". Women's advancements in political, social and economic life had been remarkable in recent years. Angolan authorities had been developing economic policies that would enable all members of society to reap the benefits of gain in recent years. He fully supported the presidential statement to be adopted.
IGNACIO YBANEZ, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs of Spain, affirmed the interdependence of all pillars of the United Nations. Peace could no longer be seen as just the absence of war, but must be seen as including the personal security of citizens and the overcoming of inequality, as well as educational reform to combat hate speech and promote respect for human rights. Inclusion was key for the internal stability of a country.
 

Spain understood that well, having long been a pluralistic nation and having strove to build unity within diversity. Social policies to integrate immigrants were part of that effort. Spanish development cooperation was guided by inclusiveness, as was diplomacy, with Spain a key participant in United Nations mediation as well as dialogue between cultures. There was no point in having a ceasefire without addressing the root causes of conflict; broad inclusiveness was critical in that effort.
VITALY I. CHURKIN (Russian Federation) fully endorsed improvement in the tools of the United Nation for preventing conflict, including universal standards of international law and building respect for the United Nations Charter, with peacebuilding assistance targeting capacity-building of institutions at a national level. He opposed, however, a broad interpretation of sustainable development, which could lead to greater politicization of the effort. Discussion of development in the Security Council could do just that and obfuscate efforts in the distinct areas of peace and security, development and human rights; his country valued the appropriate division of labour in the Organization. That being said, his country also valued social cohesion throughout society.
NAME TO COME (Nigeria) said that lessons learned from the Millennium Development Goals had confirmed the link between peace and security and inclusive development. He therefore encouraged the engagement of all parts of the United Nations system for the achievement of inclusiveness. The Council should emphasize, therefore, inclusiveness in all its activities. Nigeria's strategy to countering extremism prioritized inclusiveness by addressing the key issues fuelling insurgencies, resulting in changes in the educational system and strategies for youth employment. Nigeria played a central role in the region in promoting stability.
NAME TO COME (Jordan) said that there were many examples of the link between inclusive development and security, but inclusive development had not received the attention it deserved. Integrated peacebuilding should address the interrelatedness of all United Nations pillars. Structures that led to inequality and insecurity must be changed. He rejected the marginalization of any component of society, warning of the spillover effects. National ownership was key in achieving sustainable peace and all stakeholders must be involved in realistic strategies that took into consideration the particularities of all situations, including local knowledge and internal dynamics. Women must be empowered to participate in all areas, and youth must be a primary focus, not only to combat extremism but also to address the root causes of conflict.
NAME TO COME (Lithuania) said that the cycle of violence could not be broken and a durable peace could not be built as long as significant inequalities prevailed and economic, political and social inclusion matters remained unaddressed. As demonstrated repeatedly, human rights violations were often the first, early warning signals of a conflict about to erupt, and when ongoing became an obstacle to reconciliation and peacebuilding processes, and, thus, inclusive development. The Human Rights Up Front initiative should lie at the core of all preventive, peacebuilding and development efforts. In addition, women's full participation in the political, economic, and other domains were a key driving force of societal transformation and economic prosperity. Peace and development could not be sustained without accountability. Failure to address lingering grievances, lawlessness and impunity were ""deeply erosive"", sowing mistrust and hampering reconciliation. Conversely, the rule of law, which was at the core of democratic governance, offered a framework of justice and equity. She called for the building of rule of law and national judicial and law enforcement capabilities to be addressed early on within the context of peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts.
ALEXIS LAMEK (France) welcomed today's debate, noting that the topic had not been discussed in the Council since 2011. Inclusive development was a condition to international peace and security. States should prevent the outbreak of conflict in the first place. Establishing inclusive institutions and upholding the rule of law was key to lasting peace. Gender equality was a fundamental human right, and women were a factor for stabilizing society. His Government had cooperated with UN-Women on numerous projects, including a programme to support young women's employment in Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt. As countries exited crisis, fair sharing of power between warring parties was crucial. In that regard, women could play a role of game changer. They should be involved in peace negotiations at an early stage. He welcomed undeniable progress made by the peacebuilding architecture since its inception 10 years ago as well as two reviews this year, namely of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture and of its peacekeeping operations. This year also marked the seventieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations. The Organization's approach to crisis management should be strengthened to be more preventive and inclusive. As long as exclusiveness existed, peace and security could not flourish.
RAFAEL DARIO RAMIREZ CARRENO (Venezuela) said Latin America and the Caribbean stood out as a zone of peace, characterized by steady improvements in the last two decades in peace, security and development. The international community must join forces in a frank, open way to find the root causes of the political, economic and social imbalances in the current global system, including the current unsustainable production model, which fuelled conflicts. The international community must give higher priority to the sustainable development agenda. Developed countries must fulfil their commitments in terms of official development assistance (ODA), technology transfer and climate change. Developing countries deserved preferential, differentiated treatment in the economic and trade spheres, and aid to reach the Millennium Development Goals without conditions. Donors needed to honour their aid commitments to Haiti. The
 

promotion of inclusive, equitable development in Venezuela was a fundamental part of the Bolivarian Revolution, carried out through social programmes to end poverty, social exclusion, illiteracy, hunger and disease. Development was an inherent right for all Venezuelan citizens.
NAME TO COME (China) said that inclusiveness could help eliminate the root causes of conflict. The United Nations should attach greater importance to the development agenda as underdevelopment could cause the emergence of conflict and terrorism. Developed countries should step up ODA to developing countries and open markets and transfer technology to them. The United Nations should also strengthen its functions of mediation and good offices enshrined in Chapter VI of the Charter while upholding a culture of peace. Relapse into conflict must be prevented. Reconstruction through coordinated economic and social development was vital. Post-conflict countries must strengthen their governing ability, improve basic services and provide employment to youth and empower women. Planning and coordination must be intensified for greater synergy. The Peacebuilding Commission had an important coordinating role to play. Citing that 70 per cent of the Council agenda related to Africa, he reaffirmed his country's support for the continent's peace and security and development by helping African States find their own solutions to their problems.
JIM MCLAY (New Zealand) urged practical approaches and solutions in establishing and ensuring inclusive development, including that departing United Nations missions leave behind a strong workforce which can find long-term employment following any mission drawdown. For sustainable peace to become a reality in a post-conflict situation, addressing that conflict's root causes required the Council and the Organization as a whole to adopt a multidimensional, integrated approach. Peace agreements and reconciliation must embrace all with ""a stake in that peace"", particularly women, youth and former combatants. He welcomed the deploying of gender advisers in missions to ensure the inclusion of women in electoral systems and protect women and girls from sexual violence. In his region, inclusive approaches had been an essential part of sustainable peace and development. New Zealand's partnership with Timor-Leste had supported that country graduating from being a beneficiary of peacekeeping to becoming a contributor to United Nations peace operations. That country was now a global leader in the ""G7+"", which was an example of a beneficiary ""giving back"", and its recent interventions had been instrumental in Guinea-Bissau's return to democracy.
NAME TO COME (Chad) stressed the need to address the numerous conflicts within States before they became threats to international peace and security. As mentioned in the concept note, inequality was a major root cause of conflict and an inclusive society was crucial to development. While States had a primary responsibility to prevent conflict, the Council was playing an important role in such places as Iraq, Yemen, Mali, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Libya. Including youth and women in the post-conflict processes was imperative, he said, urging Governments to increase investment in activities to empower women and the fight against exclusion. He welcomed the presidential statement issued today, highlighting a recommendation to intensify efforts to address underdevelopment, which was a root cause of conflict in Africa. The United Nations could better support regional efforts by providing financial and human resources.
MARK LYALL GRANT (United Kingdom) said that the Council should reflect on how it could support countries to develop inclusive national institutions. First, patience was required because there were no shortcuts to building inclusive national institutions. The World Bank estimated that in a best case scenario, making meaningful improvements to institutions took between 10-17 years. Where national political institutions were not inclusive, the potential for conflict increased. The Council was designed to be ""a smoke detector"" not just ""a fire extinguisher"". The relationship between violent extremism and the absence of inclusivity was complex, as shown in the shocking attacks in France, Yemen, Nigeria, Iraq, Syria and Pakistan. Inclusivity was meaningless without women's active participation in political institutions, peace negotiations and policymaking. ""Without women, we will only achieve unbalanced and unsustainable peace, which ignores the needs of half the population.""
HUSSEIN HANIFF (Malaysia), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, said that given an increasingly turbulent world with increasingly complex threats, there was room for a more holistic approach to combating the underlying causes of conflict. States and their partners must identify as a matter of priority factors that could frustrate the aim of achieving cohesive and inclusive societies. Addressing such factors was foremost a national responsibility, but the Council was well placed to support such efforts through peacekeeping and special political missions and other tools. The role played by women was crucial, and Malaysia was carrying out long-term strategies to ensure women's equitable participation. Youth opportunity was equally important, as were civil and political rights. As a multi-ethnic society, Malaysia was aware of the challenges of diversity in achieving inclusivity. Describing some of his country's programmes in that regard, he said that inclusiveness must go hand-in-hand with other values, such as tolerance and moderation.",Security Council - Maintenance of International Peace and Security [document],All Africa AFNWS English

Jan 21, 2015 (United Nations/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Farhan Haq, Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General.
Hello, good afternoon, everyone.
**Security Council
The Secretary-General spoke at this morning's Security Council meeting on inclusive development, which was chaired by Chilean President Michelle Bachelet. The Secretary-General said that 2015 is a year of action on sustainable development. He noted the efforts to complete the work of the Millennium Development Goals, to launch a new post-2015 sustainable development agenda and reach agreement on climate change.
He said that he is encouraged to note that in their deliberations so far, Member States have paid considerable attention to peace and security and to human rights. The Secretary-General said that there is a growing consensus that the high levels of inequality we have seen in recent decades are socially, politically and environmentally damaging. Development that excludes part of the population can be socially corrosive. It can contribute to crime and create a sense of hopelessness and alienation - conditions that can breed extremism. The Secretary-General added that the United Nations system stands ready to increase its support for countries in promoting inclusive development. We have his remarks online.
**Secretary-General's Travels
The Secretary-General will depart New York on the evening of Wednesday, 21 January, to travel to Davos, Switzerland, where he will attend the World Economic Forum. He will meet leaders, both from the public and private sector, and will participate in World Economic Forum sessions on tackling climate change, development and growth, and as well as on global food security. While in Davos, he will also take part in events to address vulnerability and other issues.
The Secretary-General will return to New York on Saturday, 24 January. The Deputy Secretary-General will join the Secretary-General in Davos and will hold meetings there on sustainable development, climate change and violent extremism, among other topics.
**Ukraine
As you will have seen in a statement we issued yesterday evening, the Secretary-General is alarmed by the severe escalation of fighting for control of Donetsk airport in eastern Ukraine, which has already caused numerous casualties and threatened to completely unravel a hard-won September 2014 ceasefire. He implores all sides to make good on their commitments under the Minsk Protocol and Memorandum, with the first step being an immediate and full cessation of hostilities. The Secretary-General stresses that further deterioration of a situation that has led to heavy loss of life and civilian suffering must be avoided at all costs. The United Nations stands ready to support all efforts towards de-escalation and the resumption of a genuine peace process to restore Ukraine's stability and territorial integrity.
**Ebola
The UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, or UNMEER, highlighted encouraging statistics that have emerged from Liberia's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare that 12 of the country's 15 counties have had no new cases within the past seven days. The three counties that are still reporting new cases in Liberia include Grand Cape Mount, Margibi and Montserrado.
Meanwhile, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone all reported their lowest weekly number of cases in months, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Guinea reported its lowest weekly total of new cases since 17 August 2014. Liberia has had no confirmed cases nationally for the final two days of the week ending the 11 January. Sierra Leone has recorded its lowest weekly total of new cases since 31 August 2014.  

UNMEER said this is very good progress, but cautions all involved in the fight against the virus to remain on high alert and continue the high intensity of response efforts. Meanwhile, over the weekend, the World Health Organization declared Mali free from active Ebola transmission.
**Mali
On Mali, a high-level delegation of the UN Mission in that country visited Kidal today to show their support and solidarity with MINUSMA [United Nations Stabilization Mission in Mali] personnel. This follows the attack on the Mission's camp in Kidal, on Saturday, in which one peacekeeper was killed and four others wounded. The Secretary-General strongly condemned the attack in a statement we issued Saturday. And he said that this only highlights the urgency of reaching a political settlement to end the conflict and enable the full restoration of State authority across the entire Malian territory. His full statement is online.
**Central African Republic
In the Central African Republic, on Saturday, 17 January, peacekeepers from the UN [Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization] Mission in the country, MINUSCA, arrested the anti-Balaka leader Ngaibona Rodrigue, known as ""General Andilo"", in Bouca, Ouham Province, following an arrest warrant issued by the Public Prosecutor of the Central African Republic. Later on, ""Andilo"" was transferred to Bossangoa, where he was handed over to the authorities, and he was then transferred to Bangui. This is the first high-profile arrest that MINUSCA has executed under the Temporary Urgent Measures mandate in 2015. The Mission has, since September 2014, arrested over 200 individuals in its support to the Central African authorities to maintain the rule of law in the country.
**Libya
Over the weekend, the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) issued statements welcoming the ceasefire declaration made by parties in Libya, as well as an announcement in Tripoli by Spokesman Omar Humeidan to join the second round of talks. The ceasefire will also allow humanitarian access to people in need in affected areas and encourage international organizations to resume full operations in the country. UNSMIL, the UN [Support] Mission in Libya, says that the announcements broaden the base of support for the process aimed at restoring security and stability to Libya. The Mission also took note of the proposal to hold the next round of talks in Libya. It's consulting with Libyan stakeholders to identify an acceptable venue that also provides maximum security to the participants.
**Appointment
I have an appointment today. The Secretary-General is announcing today the appointment of Major General Purna Chandra Thapa of Nepal as the Head of Mission and Force Commander of the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF). Major General Thapa succeeds Lieutenant General Iqbal Singh Singha of India. The Secretary-General is grateful to Lieutenant General Singha for his dedicated leadership during a particularly difficult period in the mission's history. Major General Thapa brings to his new position extensive command experience and knowledge of peacekeeping attained through service at the national and international levels. There is a full biographical note in our office.
And that's it for me. Yes, Nizar?
**Questions and Answers
Question: Farhan, the intelligence today about the attack by Israel against some members of Hizbullah and other Iranians inside Syria was unnoticed. I mean, United Nations kept quiet about that. How do you view that? Does it really help the stability of the region or how do you view it?
Deputy Spokesman: We wouldn't have a comment on this reported incident. We've seen the reports but the details concerning that are murky and we would need to get more of the facts. But, certainly, anything that hurts the stability of the region is a cause for concern, and we would implore all sides to do what they can to exercise restraint and to make sure that the problems that are already present in the region, the tensions that are already there, are not exacerbated.
Question: But, the helicopter, of course, which has been reported, shot against the... and I'm sure was noticed by the UNDOF. Did they report anything to you?
Deputy Spokesman: What I can say on that is that, on 18 January -- that is to say, yesterday -- the UN Disengagement Observer Force observed two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying from the Alpha side and crossing the ceasefire line. The mission saw the UAVs moving towards the general direction of UN Position 30, following which they lost sight of the UAVs. An hour later, smoke was observed coming from the general direction of Position 30; however, the origin of the smoke could not be identified by the mission. Subsequently, UNDOF observed UAVs flying from the general area of Position 30 and over Jabbata, crossing
 

the ceasefire line. This incident is a violation of the 1974 Agreement on Disengagement between Israeli and Syrian forces. Yes?
Question: Sure. Thanks a lot. I have some other questions but you mentioned Kidal and this visit to northern Mali. Just now at the stakeout, the Chadian Permanent Representative said pretty clearly that he's been asking DPKO [Department of Peacekeeping Operations] to relocate the Chadian troops out. He said they're the ones forward deployed there since January 2013 and it's unfair and essentially puts them at risk. So, I wanted to know... he said one other thing that I want you to comment on, which is that, you know, Chad has sent its troops to Cameroon to combat Boko Haram. And I wanted to know whether... is there any UN either planning or political role in this multinational move in that region? So, it's two things that he said there. What's the response by the UN?
Deputy Spokesman: Well, on the question of international action against Boko Haram, I believe this is an issue that the Security Council intends to take up, possibly this afternoon. So, you might get to hear from the Security Council on that. Regarding rotations, there's always a timetable by which troops are rotated in and out of countries. And it depends essentially on actions taken by troop-contributing countries, but our Department of Peacekeeping Operations tries to arrange with the relevant troopaEUR'contributing countries so that there's an agreement on how troops can be rotated in and out.
Question: But, what he said is... I mean, that would now be two years that they've been the ones deployed in dangerous, and he said, abysmal conditions in Kidal; and he said there's been promises of deployment of others but it hasn't taken place. So, I guess I'm wondering... DPKO, like, can somebody, whether the Under-SecretaryaEUR'General or someone else, respond to a major troopaEUR'contributing country, saying, basically, they're being left unprotected in northern Mali?
Deputy Spokesman: Like I said, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations is in contact with all of the troopaEUR'contributing countries and tries to make sure that troop contributors have arrangements that work for those nations. Ultimately, it depends on the willingness of other countries to do their own part, and of course, we keep encouraging countries to do their part so that all of the areas in which we need to be deployed have a good rotation of troops. But, we'll keep in touch with all the relevant countries on that. Yes, Yoshita?
Question: Thanks, Farhan. There are reports saying a Security Council team will visit Pakistan next week to see the action taken against banned outfits, and there are concerns as to why some banned outfits are still on Pakistani soil. Do you have any further information on this or confirmation?
Deputy Spokesman: I don't. I'd have to check. But, you may also need to check with the Security Council on that. Yes?
Question: Farhan, yesterday, as well, in Aita al-Shaab area, the Israelis attacked and injured three Lebanese soldiers with smoke gas, and they got poisoned because of that. What's the position of the United Nations regarding this attack?
Deputy Spokesman: Yes. UNIFIL [United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon] is aware of the incident and is trying to make its concerns known and is in touch with the parties on this.
Question: Why was it a violation in the Golan? Don't you have any position, like criticizing it, condemning it?
Deputy Spokesman: Of course, we criticize all violations of the agreements. I just mentioned, of course, the violation of the 1974 Agreement on Disengagement and that holds true for all of the various agreements in that region.
Question: I have another question on Bahrain. Sheikh Ali Salman, Al-Wefag Secretary General, is facing trial, as we reported, for incitement, as the authorities say. What is your position on that?
Deputy Spokesman: You've heard what we've had to say about the situation of Sheikh Ali Salman, as we said a few weeks ago from this podium. I don't have anything new to say. Of course, if there is a trial process, we would expect that due process is followed. Yes?
Question: Sure. I wanted to ask you, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there are protests against moves to extend the election scheduled for 2016, basically, to order a census before, which would put the election off, and the Government has used tear gas and live fire. Since this has taken place in Kinshasa, where the community... Mr. [Martin] Kobler and the Mission is based, what is the comment and action by MONUSCO [United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo] on the firing on protestors by the Government?
Deputy Spokesman: Regarding that, the UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, MONUSCO, is concerned about reported violent protests in Kinsasha and Goma following the debate in the National
 

Assembly and Senate regarding the review of the draft electoral law. The Mission calls for restraint and continues to underline the need for a credible, peaceful, timely and inclusive electoral process, in accordance with the tenets of the Constitution. Question: By timely, that should be understood as 2016? Deputy Spokesman: I've said what I have to say. The word ""timely"" can only mean in the appropriate amount of time. Yes. Yes, please? Correspondent: Sorry. Thank you. Deputy Spokesman: No problem. Question: Regarding the ICC [International Criminal Court] launching this preliminary examination on the situation in Palestine, as you know, the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, has rejected any cooperation with the Court. Do you have any comment on that? Deputy Spokesman: We do not have a comment on the activities of the Court. As you know, the International Criminal Court is an independent body of... it operates independently of the United Nations, and we wouldn't have a comment on their preliminary investigative work; other than to note that it... that they themselves have called this a preliminary step. Beyond that, of course, we do trust all countries to abide by the treaties to which they've signed and the statutes to which they've signed, but I wouldn't have anything to say about these particular comments. Yes? Question: Sure. I wanted to ask, this is sort of on freedom of expression or censorship. Turkey has ordered a variety of large social media companies -- Google, Facebook and Twitter -- to block the account and remove the posts of a newspaper called BirGun for reporting on some crossaEUR'border activity into Syria. And what I wanted to know is, I know there's a general position, but this is now something where the Government of Turkey has threatened to ban all of Twitter, unless they remove this newspaper from being able to be seen in the country. So, is there some... is it possible to know what the SecretaryaEUR'General believes of major countries trying to, you know, remove individual publications from the internet? Deputy Spokesman: It's clear that our general principle still holds -- that we want there to be freedom of expression and freedom of circulation of the media. Beyond that, of course, I wouldn't speculate on what happens with Twitter in the country, but it's important to know that in every country, people are able to circulate their ideas and opinions freely. Question: Right. Do you have anything on Yemen with all this fighting taking place in the capital? I heard... sorry. I heard Mr. [Jamal] Benomar is on his way. Is that true? And also, what's the position of the UN on what should take place? Deputy Spokesman: What I can say is that we are following with deep concern the recent developments in Sana'a. Jamal Benomar, the Secretary-General's Special Adviser on Yemen, is in the region and assessing the situation on the ground. We hope to have more for you later. Have a good afternoon, everyone.",Daily Press Briefing By the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General [document],All Africa AFNWS English

Jan 20, 2015 (The Inquirer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- It has become a tradition or culture that whenever an institution or individual celebrates or observes certain events like birthday or anniversary, such is usually characterized by felicitations and best wishes to the institution or individuals by friends, well wishers and others, primarily, wishing the person or institution well in future undertakings. In some instances, there are always sentiments, wishing the person or institution long life and prosperity in future endeavours.
It is logically to deduce that many times these greetings of goodwill are intended to motivate the person or institution to work harder for greater achievements and accomplishments, rather than being complacent for whatever achievements. More importantly, they are intended to inspire one or an institution to aim high in the attainment of whatever goals or aspirations set by that person or institution.
Like in the case of THE INQUIRER Newspaper that celebrated 24 years of existence last Thursday, it was obvious that this usual spirit of felicitations and compliments would come from certain individuals and institutions. This year was quite a different one as greetings even came from President Ellen-Johnson-Sirleaf.
Earlier, Vice President Joseph Boakai last Thursday and Dr. Togba-Nah Tipoteh, an eminent politician, and a lover of the press, congratulated the newspaper for observing another anniversary. Also, Internal Affairs Minister, Morris Dukuly, a journalist and Communicator, made similar compliments to the management and staff of the newspaper.
THE INQUIRER Newspaper, as it is known, was founded by some young Liberian journalists, who prior to the country's civil conflict chewed their teeth with the Daily Observer. Today, it remains the oldest post-war independent newspaper that was established on January 15, 1991.
As stated earlier, the founders of the institution who were once in the employ of the Daily Observer Newspaper established The INQUIRER to fill in the gap of communication which was disrupted as a result of the Liberian civil crisis. The Daily Observer Newspaper at the time was shut down due to the civil crisis.
The six young men saw the need to give Liberians and others who fully relied on the BBC news, firsthand information in relations to the crisis and progress that was made by the international community in ending the crisis and bringing peace in the country. Since 1991, the paper has continued to survive in spite of the difficult circumstances it encountered during the civil crisis in October 1992 with ""Operation Octopus"", April 6, 1996, September 1998, and the 2003 saga that has been dubbed:"" ""War, War II, and Ill"". The institution suffered a major setback during the April 6. 1996 war as its offices on Carey Street at the time were set ablaze.
Despite this major setback, the staff, with strong determination and commitment to serving the Liberian people, the management, upon the cessation of hostilities, began operating in the burnt offices on Carey Street.
It was from that unsafe offices, that it was able to produce the first newspaper after the April 6 incident that also recorded that as a short period that experienced the worst looting in recent time. There is likelihood that this massive looting in Monrovia might apopear in the Guiness Book of Record, as ""The Worst Looting Incident In Few Hours.""
The incident was a result of conflict among some of the warring factons in Monrovia at the time. That incident which has now been recorded in Liberian history, saw a marriage of convenience between the rivalry forces of Charles Taylor and that of AlhajiKromah combining forces to arrest another warlord the late Roosevelt Johnson, who had broken ranks with Kromah, thereby atomizing ULIMO into two factions- ULIMO-J (Roosevelt Johnson) and ULIMO-K (AlhajiKromah).
 

Howbeit, this piece is not intended to historicize as much had been said and reported about the history of the Liberian civil conflicts and its chronological events. What I try to do here today is to reflect and analyze some of the complimentary statements and greetings from the President of Liberia and others.
In her remarks last Friday via mobile phone, the President said to me, ""I just call to thank you for the long years of professionalism."" She then asked how everything was. I then replied, ""We are doing our best."" As for VeepBoakai, who called on Thursday, the day of the anniversary, praised the paper for ""staying in there despite all of the challenges."" He described the event as an indelible ""milestone.""
Similarly, Dr. Tipoteh, who has received many awards for being a positive politician, and popularly referred to as ""man on the ground"" for his positive engagement with the authorities on issues of national concern, hailed the newspaper for its respect ""for meritism, where assignments/promotions/rewards are given to a person because the person demonstrates commitment to telling the truth.""
Dr. Tipoteh, the venerable leader of the Movement For Justice in Africa (MOJA), went on to say, "" within the context of telling the truth, one is designated a task with attendant benefits on the basis of record/performance rather than on the basis of money used to influence decisions. Then, there is respect for the culture of justice where people are treated fairly, demonstrating that the pen is mightier than the sword, thereby inspiring people, especially the youths, to use non-violent methods in attending to problems, no matter how difficult.""
For his part, Internal Minister Dukuly, in his encomium to the paper Friday morning, commended it for its high level of maturity in its reportage. Particularly, he thanked me for trying to provide some pieces of advice to upcoming journalists. He said he was impressed with my recent comments about distinguishing between news, editorials and commentaries. ""I hope the young people are listening to you; I hope they are learning lessons from you,"" Minister Dukuly pointed out.
Also, a Liberian financial expert in the United States ,AustineFallah , thanked the paper for withstanding the test of time for 24 years. ""Your dedicated service to the people of Liberia through professional journalism must be commended by all well meaning Liberians and Liberian partners in progress. You have been there for your nation through good, difficult and very, very bad times... ""
Even yesterday, during the paper's anniversary worship service at the Immanuel Church on the S.D. Cooper Road in Paynesville, the Senior Pastor of the Church, S. AdreanNeufville urged the staff of the newspaper to always strive for the truth. He then said, ""everything in life is not for profit, but service,"" and pointed that if one wants to get something, such person must work for it.
As the institution plans to climax the celebration this weekend with a ""Family Day,"" let me say that I take serious note of all of these complimentary comments that have been made by the President and others. Personally I see these congratulatory comments as a challenge to The Inquirer, which today stands as a pride for this country because it has been able to survive all odds and uncertainties during the years of conflict.
The fact that THE INQUIRER continues to operate in a peaceful environment, much is expected of it, and more so, if it can operate as a professional institution during crisis time, then, it is bound to succeed and also to remain a symbol of what can happen when people move on with courage, determination and commitment for a common purpose and goal.
As we enter another year of operation, we are aware of the challenges before us and notwithstanding, we wish to assure the public and others of our commitment to continue to remain professional and adhere to the ethical standard of the profession. We see these comments and messages on our anniversary as a challenge to continue to do the best we can to command the respect and admiration of the public.
With God above, we will always strive to live up to expectations, being fully aware that , as humans, we are not perfect, but will always conceal and act accordingly to correct ourselves, as this would add more to how the public sees us. As humans, we will always strive to be professional, accurate and objective, and at the same time be fully aware of our social responsibility, which demands that we put the interest of the society above all other things.
Lastly, to say it the Liberian way, we will not behave like ""white children"" that decolor its whiteness just after being praised for being immaculate.
Once again, we pledge our commitment to GOOD JOURNALISM and also being an antithesis of mediocrity for a better Liberia. As the Pastor challenged us yesterday, while being aware that we are also in business, we will remain focused in serving the interest of the society.","To the Inquirer On Its 24th Anniversary Taking Notes of the Compliments [opinion]

MONROVIA, Liberia -- The Swiss authorities have arrested a former commander of a Liberian rebel military faction who is accused of ordering civilian massacres, rapes and other atrocities in northern Liberia during the nation's first civil war from 1989 to 1996. The arrest was reported this week on the website of Civitas Maxima, a network of international lawyers and investigators. The former commander, Alieu Kosiah, of the military faction United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy, known as ULIMO, had been living in Bern, in western Switzerland, since 1997, said Morisara Doumbia, a leader of a Liberian association in the city. Mr. Kosiah was arrested on Nov. 10 in connection with accusations that he was involved in mass killings in parts of Liberia's Lofa County from 1993 to 1995, when he was a commander of ULIMO, a faction that later split along ethnic lines. Complaints had been filed against him by seven Liberians, represented by Alain Werner, director of Civitas Maxima, which has been working since 2012 with the Global Justice and Research Project in Liberia to document crimes committed during the wars. The seven witnesses are currently in Liberia. A pretrial investigation could take months. Liberia's back-to-back civil wars killed about 250,000 people. The fighting ended in August 2003, with the signing of a cease-fire agreement and President Charles Taylor's departure into exile. Mr. Doumbia contended that Mr. Kosiah's forces did not commit major crimes and only defended themselves against Mr. Taylor's forces. He called Mr. Kosiah ''a well-disciplined commander.'' Mr. Kosiah's arrest is the second of a Liberian in Europe in connection with accusations of atrocities committed during Liberia's civil war.

Jan 16, 2015 (Forum on China-Africa Cooperation/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- At the invitation of the government of Mozambique, Minister of Justice Wu Aiying, as the special envoy of President Xi Jinping, will attend the inauguration ceremony of President-elect Filipe Nyusi on January 15 in Mozambique.
On January 12 local time, Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the Special Consultation in Support of the IGAD-led South Sudan Peace Process in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, delivering a key-note speech and putting forward China's initiatives on advancing South Sudan peace process.
Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that as a friendly country to South Sudan and a major responsible country, China has been following South Sudan situation closely and proactively prompting the peace process. China is a promoter, advocate and participant of the peace process in South Sudan.
The South Sudan situation has come to a critical point, and all parties should step up the sense of urgency, put more weight on the overall interests, take concrete actions and properly resolve the South Sudan issue as soon as possible. China is willing to play a proactive and constructive role to this end.
Wang Yi put forward four initiatives on resolving the South Sudan conflict. First, violence should be discarded and comprehensive ceasefire should be realized.
The conflicting parties should safeguard the realistic and long-term interests of the South Sudan people as well as regional peace and stability, and reach comprehensive ceasefire without any precondition.
Second, a transitional government should be formed as soon as possible. Both parties should build on the existing negotiation outcomes, seize the opportunity, show sincerity and accelerate negotiations on forming a South Sudan transitional government following the principles of starting with easy things and seeking common ground while shelving differences.
Third, the major mediator role played by IGAD should be firmly supported. Meanwhile, the international community should continue to support and coordinate with IGAD in mediating and supervising the ceasefire. Fourth, the humanitarian situation in South Sudan should be alleviated as soon as possible.
The conflicting parties should make down-to-earth efforts to ease the grave humanitarian situation in conflicting zones and provide conveniences for international humanitarian access.
The international community should provide more assistance to effectively relieve the misery of the South Sudan people. Foreign Minister Wang Yi hoped that the conflicting parties can genuinely safeguard the safety of foreign personnel and institutions in South Sudan, and protect important infrastructure that bears on the national interests and people's livelihood of South Sudan so as to create necessary conditions for future economic reconstruction and development in South Sudan.
All the attending parties have expressed gratitude and welcome to China for proposing to hold this special consultation and putting forward relevant initiatives.
They believe that what China has done will contribute to South Sudan peace process, and that by making efforts to push forward South Sudan peace, China is supporting peace and security of Africa.
Given the current circumstances, China's initiatives and efforts are timely and more than precious. All parties attach great importance to this consultation and are willing to work with the Chinese side to push for progress in South Sudan peace process.
On January 12, three Ebola patients were discharged from the Ebola treatment center built by China for Liberia after making a full recovery from the disease, and a seeing-off ceremony was held for them by the center.  

They are two females and one 7-year-old boy. After being admitted to the center last December with their blood samples tested positive, the three patients were once in a critical condition. With the hard work and good care of the medical team for nearly 20 days, the three patients received negative results in blood tests for two consecutive times and were confirmed as cured based on World Health Organization regulations. This represents that China has made great achievements in assisting Liberia in combating Ebola at the current state. Assistant Minister of Public Health of Liberia Tolbert Nyenswah said that China's medical center have admitted numbers of Ebola-infected patients in a short span of time, some of whom have recovered and left the center. Liberian President Sirleaf asked him to convey her sincere thanks to the medical staff in the center for their conscientious work. The Liberian people are also grateful to China's treatment center. Among those recovered is Celestine King, who is a table-tennis player of the Liberian national team. She is not only a national champion of table-tennis, but also a winner in combating Ebola. She said that in the medical center, she had received meticulous treatment and care from the Chinese medical staff and then recovered soon. She is deeply grateful to the Chinese medical staff and the medical center for giving her a second life. China is also inspired by the recovery of Ebola patients in the treatment center. China is willing to work with the international community to contribute more to help relevant countries and people in Africa fight against Ebola. Q: First, recently terrorist attacks hit Nigeria. Will China send military force to help the Nigerian government fight against terrorism? A: On your first question, China is against all forms of terrorism and supports Nigeria's efforts in safeguarding national security and stability.","Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hong Lei's Regular Press Conference On January 13, 2015 [press release]",All Africa AFNWS English

Jan 15, 2015 (Daily Independent/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Today January 15 has become a commemorative date in the history of Nigeria. It not only marks the date of the first military coup that toppled the First Republic, it also marks the date the Nigeria / Biafra Civil War of 1967 to 1970 officially ended. It also in a very significant way marks the commemoration of the Armed Forces Day also called Remembrance Day. The Remembrance Day is dedicated to remembering men and women who laid down their lives in defence of the country.
The Remembrance Day is celebrated on every November 11 in the British Commonwealth to coincide with the Poppy Day for the World War II veterans in the British Commonwealth of Nations. Although Nigeria remains a member of the British Commonwealth, the Federal government moved the Remembrance Day to January 15 because of the significance of the day in the military annals. The Federal Government thought it wiser for the Armed Forces Remembrance Day to be celebrated in honour of the men and women who gave their lives fighting for the unity of the country rather than honouring soldiers who fought for the British Empire. More than two million people died in the Nigeria / Biafra Civil War that almost tore apart the unity of Nigeria.
The Armed Forces Remembrance day is also used to honour Nigerians who were enlisted in the British constabulary and were drafted to Europe to partake in World Wars I and II and all the other officers, men and women of the Nigerian armed forces including the police and other para-military organisations who have paid the ultimate sacrifice maintaining peace at home and in other parts of the globe where they had been deployed on peace keeping missions.
Nigeria ranks among the topmost Troop Contributing Countries of the world whenever the need for a peace keeping mission arises anywhere in the world. The Nigerian armed forces have demonstrated its capability to mobilise, deploy, and sustain brigade-sized forces in support of peacekeeping operations around the world. These include in Liberia, the former Yugoslavia, Angola, Rwanda, Somalia, and Sierra Leone. In August 2003 Nigerian troops were once again into Liberia, at the urging of the United States, to provide an interim presence until the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) arrived. In October 2004, Nigerian troops again deployed into Darfur, Sudan to spearhead an African Union force to stop the genocide in Darfur. Nigeria has contributed more than 20,000 troops/police to various UN missions since 1960. The Nigeria Police Force and troops have served in places like UNIPOM (UN India-Pakistan Observer mission) 1965, UNIFIL in Lebanon 1978, the UN observer mission, UNIIMOG supervising the Iran-Iraq ceasefire in 1988, former Yugoslavia 1998, East Timor 1999, and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) 2004. There is presently a Joint Task Force in the Niger Delta region designated ""Restore Hope."" And another in the North East parts of the country where they are daily fighting to bring the Boko Haram insurgency under control. Nigerian officers have served as chiefs of defence in other countries, with Brigadier General Maxwell Khobe serving as Sierra Leone chief of staff in 1998-1999, and Nigerian officers acting as Command Officer-in-Charge of the Armed Forces of Liberia from at least 2007.
Under the 1999 Constitution, the Nigerian armed forces are charged with the responsibility of the defence of the territorial integrity and of the country as contained in Section 217 (1) - (2) (d) of the constitution which says that: 217. (1) There shall be armed forces for the Federation which shall consist of an army, a navy, an Air Force and such other branches of the armed forces of the Federation as may be established by an Act of the National Assembly. (2) The Federation shall, subject to an Act of the National Assembly made in that behalf, equip and maintain the armed forces as may be considered adequate and effective for the purpose of - (a) defending Nigeria from external aggression; (b) maintaining its territorial integrity and securing its borders from violation on land, sea, or air; (c) suppressing insurrection and acting in aid of civil authorities to restore order when called upon to do so by the President, but subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly; and (d) performance such other functions as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly. (3) The composition of the officer corps and other ranks of the armed forces of the Federation shall reflect the federal character of Nigeria.
 

In keeping with these constitutional responsibilities, Nigerians from all parts of the country have in the discharge of their duties as officers and men and women of the Nigerian armed forces, stood side by side as comrades in arms in the defence of the country. It is noteworthy that the Nigerian armed forces have since its establishment, fought in a civil war to keep the territorial integrity of the country intact as well as participated in several peacekeeping operations around the world.
Countless officers and men and women of the Nigerian armed forces died in these operations and the Armed Forces Remembrance Day celebrations is dedicated to remembering and appreciating Nigerian military men who died in the service of the nation and their surviving colleagues who have retired from active service. These men indeed put their lives on the line for their friends.
As part of activities ahead of today's celebrations, President Goodluck Jonathan had in December last year launched the Emblem and Fund raising for members of the Legionnaires during which he directed that all public officers wear the emblem till today's laying of wreath to mark the end of the celebration. He had also promised that his government will continue to take the welfare of the Legionnaires at heart even as modalities and implementation have begun towards increasing their pension.
Unfortunately, the Armed Forces Remembrance Day seems to have to a large extent become merely a yearly ritual of promises and little action. The practice over the years in Abuja, the 36 state capitals as well as in other military formations across the country has been a parade at the Cenotaph of the Unknown Soldier, 21-gun salute, playing of the 'Last Post' a military funeral song usually played in commemoration of those who have been killed in war, a minute's silence, laying of wreaths and release of pigeons to symbolise peace.
However, as Nigerians observe this annual event, investigations reveal that such promises of improved welfare and care may have become mere rhetoric of empty promises. Despite the fact that virtually all successive governments at all levels have always made similar promises to see to the welfare of these brave men and women, they are mostly forgotten as soon as the pigeons are released from their cages to bring the event to an end.
A call for prayers:
Just like in the previous years, church services were held across the country last Sunday in commemoration of the Armed Forces Remembrance day. On the preceding Friday, a Jumat service had also held in mosques across the country. At an inter-denominational church service held at the National Christian Centre in Abuja, President Jonathan called on Nigerians to be steadfast in their prayers for members of the armed forces and their families for their sacrifices in the war on terrorism. The President said the armed forces and other security services deserved the prayers and commendations of Nigerians for laying down their lives to defend the country's unity and territorial integrity. He described members of the armed forces as ""gallant people"" working hard day and night with other security agencies to ensure that Nigerians sleep at night.
He said: ""Let me call on all Nigerians to continue to pray for the armed forces, their families and their wives because it is not easy to be wife of a soldier especially when he is posted to a state like Borno.
""We know what they are passing through; they need our prayers; we have to commend, encourage and support them,"" the President said, noting that the security challenges facing the country could have been worse but for the gallantry and commitment of the armed forces in the fight against the insurgency. He also pledged that his administration would continue to invest in the welfare of military personnel and their families through programmes like the recently launched Victim Support Fund.
On his part, Archbishop Samuel Uche, the prelate, Methodist Church of Nigeria, in his sermon lauded the armed forces for their patriotism in the defence of Nigeria and some countries in Africa. He commended the armed forces for their gallantry over the years, attributing the difficulties faced by the military in the war against insurgency to the activities of saboteurs in the military and the political class. According to him, ""Arresting the menace of Boko Haram is proving difficult because of the many disgruntled elements who are involved.""
In Asaba, Delta State, Governor Emmanuel Uduaghan called for actions which will deepen the peace and unity of the country. Speaking at an inter-denominational thanksgiving service at the Cathedral Church of St. Peters (Anglican Communion), Asaba, he said it was important for Nigerians to shun actions that were capable of dividing Nigerians, adding that peaceful co-existence should not be compromised on the altar of selfish ego.
Essence of the remembrance:
In the heat of the 2014 edition of the Armed Forces Remembrance Day, Ishola Williams, a retired Major General of the Nigerian Army had argued that the Remembrance Day, ""helps us to accept that a nation like ours, having fought a civil war must never think of going through the same route. Even though we have had Coups, we have gone through many crises without shooting at each other. We will continue to do better. For  

the soldier, the worst nightmare is to shoot or torture your fellow countrymen and women who are brothers and sisters because as Nigeria urbanise and attain political maturity, ethnocentrism will be minimised. The experiences of other countries' middle class in urban areas demonstrate this phenomenon.""
He however regretted that ""the day has not helped to get ECOWAS and people of the countries like Sierra Leone and Liberia to remember the blood split on their soil by Nigerian Soldiers and Journalists for the stability and security they have today."" He advocates that for the Armed Forces Remembrance Day to be truly memorable, a memorial wall should be erected to imprint the names of men and women who died for the country permanently in history. ""It is the fault of our the past and present governments which ought to have memorial walls in honour of men and women who died for us to be stable and secure without recourse to violence in the City Centres of Abuja. The wall should include Soldiers and policemen who lost their lives in Peace keeping operations (PKOs) in all parts of the world, Freetown and Monrovia with the names of Nigerian Officers, Soldiers, civilians, journalists who died in those countries. With these walls in, those countries, how can we or those countries ever forget? Their families who lost their loved ones will be proud of them. Nigerians will walk tall in the world. As for the Civil War, we need a wall in Lagos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Benin, Kaduna and Calabar with simple words ""Never Again Shall Blood Flow On This Land For Any Reason,"" he said.
According to him ""neither the Government nor the people of Nigeria respect our uniformed men, women civilians and especially their families. There are many families who are still grieving and nobody cares. The operational and post -operational care is not up to par. We could do far better but nobody has set the standards for effective Armed Forces that know that in sickness and in death they do not need to fear.
""If January 15 can be the day to do stocktaking instead of fanfare alone, Nigeria and our soldiers will gain the respect of the world. We have the best resources to build the best armed forces in Africa. But lack of strategic and operational vision, duplication of services, waste and corruption are the obstacles,"" he concluded.
Agony of the living:
Despite repeated promises by the federal Government to look into the plight of Nigeria's military retirees, the reality of the fate and conditions of living of the Nigerian Legion is however better imagined that experienced. Despite the immense contributions of these men, many of their dependants unfortunately live in deplorable conditions.
Over the years, the news media has been awash with stories of retired soldiers collapsing and dying while waiting to collect their pension from the Military Pension Board. As a matter of fact, there have been allegations of neglect by the Retired Members of Nigerian Armed Forces (REMENAF).
In a message posted on its facebook page on January 7 at 15:09 hours, REMENAF accused the Federal Government of paying lip service to their plight. They threatened to stage a protest across the country during the celebrations today ""in a manner that is unprecedented and coming at a time veterans are angered by the attitude of government towards their pitiable plight."" The message added that ""the administration of President Jonathan has a record-breaking promises and fail made in the past to address the lingering crises between it and the senior citizens.
""Only in Nigeria do veterans have to go on a ritual monthly protest to demand for what is constitutional and rightly theirs, having laboured so hard in their productive stages of life to keep Nigeria one.
""Clearly, the present administration of President Jonathan has had enough warnings to do the needful. For now, the Nigerian government still have few days to 15th January, 2015 to address the situation in order to avert the impending protest and embarrassment on the government of the day.""
They argued that the current administration of President Jonathan owed them pension of up to four years arrears ""in his full tenure in office, during which we were regularly deceived the money would soon be paid. We have been on protest from January 2014 till date and the president knows about it all, but turns his face away.
""It is the height of deceit to tell us that the money would be paid when President Jonathan finishes his tenure. We cannot know who the next President would be and we will have no moral stand to harass next President over it.
""They know where to source for fund for immediate settlement of our arrears. If we succumb to be fooled yet again, then we should forget it and keep dying rapidly in silence.""
The National Coordinator, Comrade Kay Finnih said it made no sense that the Federal Government ""will be celebrating the dead while the living is suffering"". He said REMENAF had resolved to stage protests in Abuja and the 36 states of the federation during today's Armed Forces Remembrance Day celebration to press for the payment of their pension arrears in the past three years.","Armed Forces Remembrance Day - Honours to the Dead, Agony of the Living

Jan 05, 2015 (The Reporter/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Professor Peter Wallensteen is the Dag Hammarskjold professor of Peace and Conflict Research at Uppsala University, Sweden and is also research professor of Peace Studies at the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, University of Notre Dame, US.
He is the director and founder of the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), which - since 1982 - has recorded ongoing violent conflicts and collected information on an expanding range of aspects of armed violence, including conflict dynamics and resolution. The UCDP data is one of the most-widely used data sources on global armed conflicts, and its definition of global armed conflict is becoming a standard in conflict studies. Last week he was at Addis Ababa University, Institute of Ethiopian Studies, Ras Mekonnen Hall, for a public lecture on the global conflict situation. His lecture started with the Cuba-American hostility and ended up with the South Sudan conflict. Henok Reta of The Reporter sat with the professor at the Embassy of Sweden, which is located off Yared Street, for an exclusive interview. Excerpts:
The Reporter: You said in your lecture that there have been more peace agreements than any period after the end of World War II and the Cold War when the world is still facing many challenges.
Peter Wallensteen: Yes. There have been wars and that makes people more pessimistic. There are more wars than peacemaking efforts. It is indeed partly true that in the past couple of years but the world has seen more peace agreements through various parties including the United Nations Peace and Security Council and various regional organizations. Now, we find ourselves in a new challenging situation. In some parts of the world peace appears to be declining as conflicts are escalating. However, there are success stories. For instance, in the Philippines the Christian government and the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) have managed to work out their differences. Peace process in Colombia is also another important success. Remarkably, the United States and Cuba are set to normalize their relations. These look good, but on the other side, there are problems in South Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Iraq, Syria and the Gaza strip where there are bloody confrontation.
Your handout shows a significant decline of wars and armed conflicts after the Cold War. What is the reason?
Ten years after the end of the Cold War armed conflicts and protracted wars across the world have been reduced. However, from around 2003, there have been new wars and terrorism emerged as a new factor for instability and conflict. On the other hand, tensions were looking a bit scary everywhere. The tension in the Korean Peninsula could be mentioned as one example. Latin America used to have a lot of military regimes now things are functioning in a democratic manner. Africa itself has seen relatively better governments in those years. Botswana, Ghana and some others have seen stable and inclusive governments. The societies have been engaged in those peace agreements and they were very much instrumental in insuring peace in their respective countries. External influence in the form of making weapons available for the warring parties is also another problem. Things are not always uniform. I was saying governments need to have the ability and resoluteness to engage all parts of the society. I think it's a failure having not imposed an arms embargo on Syria. That should be the first thing to do when planning to end conflict and that didn't work in Syria. That has led Syria to becoming one of the worst conflict zones in the world. We are learning how some countries avoided wars and how their success was achieved. This provides basic inputs for the research we are carrying out.
What are the basic problems that hamper peace agreements everywhere?
I think the first problem is fragmentation. There are dozens of actors in every conflict zones. They have their own agenda. For instance, if you go to Syria people talk about many things. I was told that in Syria one person has to negotiate with 50 different actors. Recruitment criteria for negotiators include tribe, religion, political or ideological affiliation and family line. This has been our major findings in the survey.
 

Despite the positive signs, there is a strong argument that conflict itself has changed its character over the years. Do you think this argument is correct?
I think it has changed its character. During the Cold War it was between the two rivals--the US and the USSR. A destructive role was played by those actors. These were two rich countries who can supply weapons and money to others. The two used to supply weapons in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and in the Horn of Africa. Nowadays, terrorism is the major source of conflict in the world. It has come out as a common feature. So, yes it has changed its manner and purpose in the course of time.
Since you have been studying the types of conflicts in the world would you please state which one is becoming common these days, and which part of the world is prone to this type of conflict?
I think it is internationalized civil wars. Some states may want to be more autonomous so they might confront governments with help from neighboring nations. Some of these countries may be bigger and richer so they can be involve enormously. That makes things tougher to deal with. Indeed, much of the literature on peace and conflict is on the interstate conflict but that has changed in the past 25 years. Ethio-Eritrea and Indo-Pakistan could be mentioned as examples. We have had more civil wars that have been internationalized, and the world has to think of ways to deal with the issue. Respecting the rights of others, becoming more inclusive, equality and finding a common ground for power sharing arrangement can be the things people should think about when dealing with situations. Since the 1980s there have been more than 200 peace agreements and most of them were changed into actuality. For example, Liberia had some 14 peace agreements to end its internal conflicts and it has been peaceful for the past ten years. That is good, but Ebola is another problem for the country because the people haven't recovered enough from the wars.
How much have you done in assessing the impact of the developed world in fueling internal conflicts in some of the developing countries which are mostly found to Africa?
The developed world might have been involved in those countries, but the most striking one is the involvement of the neighbors across the border although they say they respect the territories. I think the important thing is that a conflict in one country is actually a challenge to the region. The country should work out things by itself as quickly as possible before it opens doors for others who have an interest there. Outside powers such as France, Britain, the United States and sometimes China and Russia have enormous resources so that their involvement changes the dynamics of the conflict. So, the region has to act quickly in resolving the conflicts to keep those powers outside.
The Horn of Africa has long been associated with armed conflicts and internationalized civil war like any volatile region across the globe. Can you say a few things with regard to the region and what the future might hold?
The Horn of Africa is one fragile region. There are many tensions that need to be recognized and be dealt with in a clever way. I think some wise leadership in some of the countries in the region has brought peace negotiations ahead of conflicts and that is seen as a positive outcome for ensuring peace in the region. However, the birth of South Sudan has brought another problem to the region. Somalia still requires a lot of attention. The involvement of regional and continental organizations such as the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the AU is vital since it is a fragile region.
Some say that Ethiopia's involvement in the region has been significant in maintaining regional stability as it quashing Al-Shabaab. Do you think this is the right thing to do?
I would like to see more negotiations and more peace agreements rather than more weapons and ground troops there. Involving troops in another country may have beneficial effects but it also has risks and tensions. Your ambition to bring about peace has to be clear and complemented with participations from parts of the society there. The ultimate purpose should be that.
Do you think Kenya's involvement in Somali is a similar one with that of Ethiopia?
Both countries went to Somalia at different times and both have the right to defend themselves. However, if the efforts are emphasized on military actions you are escalating the tension. Other ways of initiations like mediation and negotiations, like what you are doing in South Sudan right now, are better options. The purpose should be expressed clearly that it's all about promotion of peace and stability in Somalia. Somalia's problem is not a regional one and it should be prioritized by the international community since that has been a 25-year-old problem. Unless the world stands together to deal with such a problem it will be very difficult to solve it. Cambodia had a similar problem and it was a problem of some countries in the 70s, 80s and early 90s, and these types of problems require more international effort.
What do you recommend is the right manner to deal with some extremists like Al-Shabaab?
 

I'm not an expert on Al-Shabaab. I think both Ethiopia and Kenya have the potential to develop other mechanisms other than military actions. That can be done with a lot more international assistance. My experience from other similar situations is that this extremist group is a faction that aspires to control power, but it doesn't necessary mean that it rejects any engagement in some sort of a peace arrangement. I don't think it's absolutely impossible to talk to these people. Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, rebels in the Sahel region around Mali or the Taliban are not intractable. They have got different sub-groups in the society so it is always dangerous to use military force. They can reunite so that no one could wipe them out forever. Very few people might like wars but many want to see peaceful settlements everywhere and these groups may wake up someday and find other solutions.
What about the situation in South Sudan?
It's a terribly sad development we have come across in South Sudan since its birth. First it looked promising when they came out of decades of war in a peaceful manner but it suddenly turned out to be a devastating conflict. I think the current peace arrangement that is currently progressing with the help of the Government of Ethiopia, the IGAD and the international community seems to be promising but there is a long way to go. It is not easy to go into such a country unless a ceasefire agreement is reached and things become calm. Security is an issue there. More attention and support from the international community could facilitate things and find a lasting solution there. An international peacekeeping force may be needed as well to pursue the peace arrangement. For the time being power-sharing looks like the only means to capitalize on the efforts being made to see a peaceful South Sudan. Maybe it is going on the same route that Liberia went through before as several peace agreements were made. The current problem in South Sudan is a problem that is linked to the wars that took place before the secession.
What can you say about the ""no-peace, no-war situation"" of Ethiopia and Eritrea that has been prevailing since the end of the dreadful war that took place between the two countries in late 90s?
It's an unhealthy situation. It brings about more danger. I don't know when the time is ripe for settlement, but it needs a lasting settlement. I know there was a commission on boundary issues and peace agreement and that have to be part of the efforts towards a lasting solution. It is very difficult to think about the future at this moment. I don't know much and I can only speculate about what can be done in the future. I think these are two proud nations can sort out their differences together and find a way to have lasting peace without external influence. They should be open to an international assistance as well when the right moment comes.
Some people associate the case in Ethiopia and Eritrea with that of India and Pakistan. Is that the future for Ethiopia and Eritrea?
The India-Pakistan case goes back to 1947 and it perhaps can be a lesson if there is any similarity. Hostilities of this sort will not benefit anyone. I hope that Ethiopia and Eritrea would normalize their relations soon.
Has your data program center in Uppsala done anything in relation to the conflicts and war between the two countries?
Yes. We were following the developments of the war since it started. We have also been observing the peace agreements that were being made between the two countries and their mediators and the final agreement when it was reached between the two leaders in Algiers in 2000. However, we were not requested to have a role in any of these peace agreements so there is no specific data.
Do you think that the peace agreement signed by the late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and Eritrean president Isaias Afeworki is a cause for the current situation prevailing between the two countries?
I don't think I am the right person to comment on that. I don't know about the details of the document. But that agreement is still prevailing and I think it's not good to go away from it. That might deteriorate things. Still, I will be very happy if Ethiopia and Eritrea ask me to help out sort their differences and if they want to come to the discussion table I will be happy to assist.
Do you think engaging elders and communal leaders in peacemaking effort is the right approach in solving problems in Africa?
It's hard to say that it is the best approach but you may have conflicts that can be dealt with this way. For instance, there is remarkable contrast between Somalia and Somaliland btu Somaliland managed to solve issues by building upon traditional means. Unfortunately, that has not been possible in Somalia. I very much applaud this when you have prominent figures like Kofi Annan, Desmond Tutu and Graca Machel. I think it's very good to look into African values and traditional practices when you are looking for solutions in Africa. For instance, in some cases, women play a crucial role in peacemaking processes Liberia can be mentioned as a good example. In Liberia women had a very crucial role to play in the peacemaking process. It should not be limited to the process of making peace but in leadership as well. I have come to understand that there is an
 

untapped resource with women in every peacemaking process. Wise women can form associations to influence the society. I think that is one area Africa should put in to use. What can you say about the peace and security institutions in Africa. Do you think they have the right structure to deal with African problems? There are institutions in South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and Ethiopia. And these institutions are crucial for promoting peace in Africa and provide information on conflicts observed on the continent. One of the projects we carry out at Uppsala is promoting these institutions to become well-organized places to study and resolve problems in the continent. We have invited some of the scholars from Africa for a quick training at Uppsala. One of these people was Professor Yacob Arsano of Ethiopia, and another smart fellow from Nigeria who unfortunately died in a plane crash. Our data program reveals that Africa has had more conflicts than any other continent followed by Asia. African countries need to depend more on African initiatives. We will be very much supportive to those African universities. One of the major roles these institutions play is that they would give you more details on the conflicts solved through a peace agreement. A peace agreement can never be an end to the conflict. South Sudan can be good example in this regard. Is water a cause for conflicts and do you see any potential for conflict between Ethiopia, Egypt and other members of the Nile basin? I think water could become a cause of conflict. One of the longest rivers in Europe is the Rhine River which flows through Switzerland, Germany, France and the Netherlands. There has been no war in relation to this river because the commission on the technicalities in 1800 had made things easy. I think the agreement between Ethiopia, Egypt, Sudan and other countries would be vital in working things out. The water belongs to everybody, and waters have no nationality. So, I'm hopeful this will work out for all the Nile basin countries. Do you agree that the current economic growth in some of African countries is a guaranty to safeguard them from any further conflicts and wars? No I don't. You have to make sure that the economy is shared by all segments of the society. Sometimes this could become an opportunity for some fanatic groups to access finances. Some countries still face problems after their economic boom because the resources are not shared equally and the democratic framework is not properly employed. The beneficiary of this economic growth should always be the mass. Moreover, the growth of a certain nation should never become a threat to its neighbor. China's economic development should never be used to build up its military because it would terrorize others in the region.","'I Will Be Very Happy If Ethiopia and Eritrea Ask Me to Help Out Sort Their Differences' [interview]

31 December 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"31 December 2014 ProPublica Investigative Reporting PPUBIR English Copyright 2014. ProPublica. All rights reserved. GARDNERSVILLE, Liberia -- More than 20 years ago, a terrible crime bloodied this suburb of cinderblock homes, dirt-floor stores and lush green bush grass.
Five American nuns were killed when a vicious battle swept through the town during Liberia's civil war. The killers left their bodies burned and broken, rotting in the sun.
The deaths were numerically insignificant in a conflict that by its end in 2003 had left hundreds of thousands of Liberians dead. But the killings crystallized the horror of Liberia's long war for Westerners.
The Catholic Church, the U.S. Embassy and Liberia's Truth and Reconciliation Commission all investigated. All came to a similar conclusion: The killers were soldiers in the army of Charles Taylor, the Liberian warlord convicted by an international court for crimes against humanity.
No killers, however, have ever been brought to justice. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation eventually launched an investigation. But long delays by the agency and a steadfast reluctance by the Liberian government to prosecute those blamed for atrocities has meant that none of the suspects has ever faced trial, according to an examination by ProPublica and Frontline.
One of those implicated by reports on the killings is Christopher Vambo, a former Taylor commander who used the nom-de-guerre General Mosquito. He is not hard to find. He lives on a rutted street across from a local cemetery in an older part of Monrovia, the country's capital. He works as a security guard for one of the country's largest communications firms.
One hot, rainy day earlier this year, Vambo agreed to an interview -- his first with American media outlets since being implicated in the sisters' deaths.
He wanted to speak. But he feared the consequences.
""Christopher Vambo wasn't the one that executed the Catholic nuns, but the Catholic nuns were executed under his command,"" he said, referring to himself in the third person. ""If there is charges for that, there's a penalty for that.""
Faith in God and the fury of war defined the lives of the five sisters.
They were members of the Adorers of the Blood of Christ convent based in tiny Ruma, Ill. Most had spent years on mission in Liberia: instructing children, healing the sick, teaching their faith.
Sisters Barbara Ann Muttra, Shirley Kolmer, Kathleen McGuire, Agnes Mueller and Mary Joel Kolmer (a cousin to Shirley) lived, worked and prayed together at a small convent of cinder blocks painted white. It lay just off the main road that runs through Gardnersville, one of Monrovia's outer suburbs.
Muttra, 69, was the best known. A nurse, she had spent 21 years working in Liberia. Her passion was working with mothers and children. She was a bulldog. She faced down soldiers and tendered care at remote clinics.
Shirley Kolmer, 61, was the leader of the group. She was well known among Monrovia's upper middle class. Grinning and gap-toothed, the math teacher served as the first female principal of St. Patrick's High School, an elite all-boy's school in a tony neighborhood of Monrovia. McGuire, 54, the newest arrival, taught there, too. She also supervised a local Catholic grammar school.
Mueller, 62, taught local women to read and worked at a nearby health clinic. Joel Kolmer, 58, taught at the grammar school and mentored young Liberians interested in entering the order.
""These kinds of people must be celebrated,"" said Kofi Woods, a Liberian human rights leader who knew the sisters.
 

This account of the lives and deaths of the nuns draws on reports by the Catholic diocese, the Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the St. Louis Post Dispatch; a book written shortly after the killings by Sister M. Clare Boehmer called Echoes in our Hearts; confidential transcripts of eyewitness testimony; and interviews with current members of the Adorers of the Blood of Christ, Liberians who knew the sisters, U.S. State Department officials, former Taylor fighters and Vamb o.
Charles Taylor's invasion of Liberia in December 1989 razed the sisters' world. His ill-trained militia and child soldiers slaughtered thousands of Krahn and Mandingo tribal members to settle old grievances.
By July 1990, Taylor's forces were battling Liberian soldiers in Gardnersville. The suburb sat just across from Monrovia, separated from the capital by mangrove swamps and a river. Bullets rained on the convent roof. Artillery crackled.
In August 1990, the sisters decided to flee back to the United States. They would not stay away long, beginning their return in March 1991.
By then, Liberia had settled into an uneasy ceasefire between Taylor's forces and West African peacekeepers. Taylor controlled much of the country. The peacekeepers protected a caretaker government in the capital.
The ceasefire allowed the sisters to return and rebuild their mission. They scrounged new furniture. They organized residents into Bible groups. They collected Christmas gifts for families receiving treatment at a nearby clinic. More than 30 children had died there since the war's start, victims of severe malnutrition.
Taylor kept busy, too. As detailed in a ProPublica and Frontline investigation, he built up his army in part with the resources of one of America's most iconic businesses: Firestone. The tire giant operated the largest rubber plantation in the world in Liberia. To do business, Firestone agreed to pay taxes to Taylor's rebel army. In exchange, Taylor provided the company protection.
By October 1992, Taylor was ready to launch a massive new assault on Monrovia dubbed Operation Octopus. Using the Firestone plantation as his headquarters, he sent thousands of men streaming toward the capital in the pre-dawn hours of Oct. 15, 1992.
Once again, the rebels struck Gardnersville. They set up mortars and cannons. They fired over the convent into the distant, huddling city.
The West African peacekeeping forces were taken by surprise. They mustered several days before counterattacking. The troops hacked toward Gardnersville, battling through gun-wielding children and rebel strong points.
By mid-October, the sisters were once again on the frontlines of the war.
On Oct. 20, heavy combat surrounded the convent.
At about 4 p.m., the convent's security guard grew worried about the violence in Barnersville, a neighboring suburb where his family lived. Muttra and Joel Kolmer agreed to drive him home.
Once the car reached the main road, witnesses saw two West African peacekeepers flag down the car. They got into the vehicle with the sisters. The car headed east on the main road, known today as Somalia Drive. It moved from peacekeeper-held territory toward a checkpoint manned by soldiers from Taylor's army, known as the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, or NPFL.
That's the last time witnesses reported seeing the two nuns, the security guard and the soldiers alive.
When Muttra and Kolmer did not return by nightfall, the remaining three sisters began to worry. By Oct. 23, they had heard nothing. The ineluctable conclusion: Muttra and Kolmer were dead.
By then, the fighting had grown much fiercer. Gunfire rattled constantly. Rocket propelled grenades streaked through the air. Two Lebanese families who lived nearby sought shelter inside the convent.
Surrounded and frightened, sisters Kathleen McGuire, Shirley Kolmer and Agnes Mueller made desperate pleas for help. Informed of their plight, the U.S. embassy asked for assistance from the West African peacekeeping force, known by the acronym ECOMOG.
On the morning of Oct. 23, peacekeepers battled to the convent, but decided evacuation was too risky. The soldiers told the sisters to sit tight. Rescue forces would extract them the following day.
 

It never happened. That evening, a small squad of Taylor's soldiers approached the convent. They were led by Vambo, according to a church report of the incident based on 10 eyewitness statements. Also present was a young soldier, called C.O. Devil, or Black Devil.
The fighters began shooting AK47s in the air, drawing the sisters outside the convent. Vambo confronted McGuire as she unlocked the gate, shooting her in the arm. She fell to the ground. Vambo executed her by firing into her neck, the report said.
Next, Vambo turned his weapon on one of the Lebanese men, the report said. One shot, and he was dead.
Vambo turned on the remaining sisters and those who had sought shelter. He screamed that he was going to kill all the ""white people"" in the convent, the report said. He demanded money and keys to the sisters' car.
The two remaining sisters, Shirley Kolmer and Agnes Mueller, lined up against the outside wall of the convent. As they pleaded for their lives, the man named Devil executed the women. Their bodies slumped onto the dirt, leaving trails of blood on the whitewashed wall.
The squad fled with their loot -- a car and a pittance of Liberian money.
Taylor's men spared several young Liberian girls, aspirants who were considering joining the convent. They were taken to Taylor territory. They managed to escape and tell their stories to the church and the U.S. embassy. Afterward, several aspirants immigrated to the United States to begin new lives. The order has continued to keep their identities secret.
The aspirants' accounts varied. Some said that Devil had done all the killing. Others blamed both Vambo and Devil.
Their accounts converged on this: Taylor's men had turned the convent into a killing ground.
In the interview with ProPublica and Frontline, Vambo acknowledged that men under his command may have participated in the attack. But he vigorously denied that he had killed anyone.
Vambo is a small, thin man with a nervous stutter and darting eyes. He wore a cap embossed with the words ""Jesus is my Boss.""
He sat on the second floor of a shabby restaurant on Monrovia's main boulevard as he told his story, a version of events riddled with inconsistencies.
""I have not talked to lot of people for this,"" said Vambo, who for years remained a fighter and security advisor for Taylor.
When the 1992 assault on Monrovia launched, Vambo was one of Taylor's most senior field commanders. His mission was to travel from the western side of the Firestone plantation to attack Monrovia's northern suburbs, including Gardnersville and Barnersville. Television footage from the time shows him strolling along Somali Drive, very close to the convent, wearing camouflage, a red beret with a star and aviator glasses. When he speaks, he stutters -- then, as now. He shows off the skeletonized remains of West African peacekeepers his men have killed.
Vambo said he was battling for control of the area on Oct. 20 when he got a radio call. Some Caucasians had been killed while approaching a rebel checkpoint in Barnersville. He needed to check it out.
When Vambo arrived, he saw a ""military car"" burning. Outside lay the bodies of the two sisters, the security guard and the two soldiers. Vambo said he received a full report from the fighters at the checkpoint.
His men told him the killings had been an accident. A vehicle coming from enemy territory approached the roadblock manned by several rebel fighters. One wielded a rocket propelled grenade launcher. When the rebels ordered the pickup to halt, gunfire erupted from the vehicle, Vambo said he was told.
""There's a motto that we got: fire; reply fire,"" Vambo said. ""Our RPG went straight in that pickup, bap!""
Vambo said his men made a mistake: ""We were not completely right,"" he said.
A few days later, on Oct. 23, Vambo said he got another call over the radio. His men told him they had stumbled upon a massacre: three Caucasian women and a Lebanese man, all dead at the nuns' convent.
A unit commander Vambo called Town Devil hailed him on the radio. When Vambo arrived, he saw the bodies lying on the ground. Vambo said he sharply questioned the fighters.
 

""You people have killed international people and we are not supposed to kill international people,"" Vambo shouted.
""No, chief, we came here and met the people dead already,"" Vambo said one man told him.
Approaching West African soldiers frightened the men away. Vambo made a report on the incident to Taylor. The warlord questioned him. Was it possible that his men had committed the massacre? Vambo said he had no proof, one way or the other.
Taylor had Town Devil executed, Vambo said. The other two rebel fighters at the convent were sent to the front lines. Both died in later fighting.
For his part, Vambo heatedly denied having seen the sisters alive. During the interview, he leapt up, gesticulating furiously. He had not killed any of the nuns.
""That's a lie, that's a lie, that's a lie,"" he shouted. ""I never met the Catholic nuns face to face.""
""If I did it, God, I will bear the pain for it,"" he said.
Like many Liberians blamed for atrocities during the war, Vambo exemplifies unfulfilled justice. His accusers have never presented their evidence to a court. Nor has he ever had the chance to clear his name.
""The worst thing I still worrying on is this same Catholic nuns,"" he said with an anxious look on his face.
""It wasn't I the one that executed the Catholic nuns,"" he said. ""I will continue to say and I will say it over and over.""
Taylor assigned John T. Richardson, one of his top advisors, to investigate the incident. Richardson came away uncertain. Taylor's army was such a fluid, ragtag affair that obtaining reliable testimony or reconstructing disputed events was near impossible.
""The way the NPFL fighters move in waves, the wave that's here today isn't there tomorrow. And nobody will even tell you they remember who was there tomorrow or yesterday,"" Richardson said. ""And so it would have been very difficult to go back in ... and find out what happened on the ground.""
The bottom line on whether Taylor fighters killed the nuns? ""Could it have happened? Yes,"" Richardson said.
The fate of the women remained a mystery for more than a week, but when the massacre was confirmed, it became an instant symbol of the savagery of Liberia's war.
World leaders decried the nuns' deaths. The U.S. demanded an immediate cease fire. The State Department issued a sternly worded, formal demand, emphasizing that the U.S. would hold Taylor responsible for any crimes committed in his area of control.
Taylor issued cautious denials of responsibility. He said that Senegalese peacekeepers controlled the area at the time the sisters were slaughtered. ""It is really no man's land, so it is anybody's guess what has happened to those nuns,"" Taylor said, according to local news accounts from the time.
Nearly a month after the killings, the fighting calmed enough to allow collection of the sisters' bodies.
At the convent, McGuire's desiccated body was found mostly intact outside the compound. Inside, Mueller and Shirley Kolmer appeared to have been shot, then hacked to pieces with machetes. Their bones were scattered across the compound. With Taylor fighters moving in, West African soldiers collected the two sister's skulls, then scrambled to gather the rest of the bones into a bag for later identification.
At the site of the RPG attack, West African soldiers, Catholic clergy and embassy officials found the incinerated skeletons of Muttra and Joel Kolmer by a burned van. Muttra slumped out of the car, as if she had died inside and fallen out after her door was opened. Kolmer was found partially under the vehicle, as though she had been knocked back by fire.
The nuns' remains were placed into aluminum caskets and loaded into C-130s on the tarmac of Monrovia's municipal airport. They were transported on separate flights back to Illinois, where they were buried in side-by-side graves at the Ruma convent.
Today, a striking, 15-foot high bronze memorial commemorates the sisters' sacrifice. It features the five of them in a circle, hands together, held up to the sky.
 

Gerald Rose was the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia when the American nuns were killed. He questioned eyewitnesses and stood on the tarmac as the sisters' bodies were loaded into planes home.
After his retirement from the foreign service, he spent years keeping the sisters' case alive. An Army veteran, he was not about to let America forget that five of its own had been brutally slaughtered. He hectored his congressional representatives. He pleaded with the State Department and the FBI to bring the killers to justice.
Rose's campaign appeared to have an effect. In 2002, nearly a decade after the killings, the FBI opened a formal investigation. Rose was questioned regarding his knowledge of the killings.
At some time in the mid-2000s, Vambo said he was twice interviewed by what he called ""CIA investigative reporters."" The chief interlocutor in one interview, he said, was named Christopher -- the same first name as Christopher Locke, the FBI's lead investigator.
In April 2010, according to a Time magazine account, Locke presented a case to the U.S. Attorney's office in Washington for prosecution. He did not name the suspects. But he told the magazine, ""we put together what I personally thought was a prosecutable case.""
In 2012, the U.S. Attorney's office decided not to file charges. Prosecutors determined that the statute of limitation had expired on any potential charges against the suspects, a spokesman told ProPublica and Frontline. The agency declined further comment.
The reasons for the decades of delay in investigating the killings are unclear.
Both the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office declined repeated requests for interviews. The FBI did not respond to a Freedom of Information Act request filed eight months ago seeking records in the closed case of the nuns' deaths. Locke, who has since left the agency, also declined to answer questions.
""The FBI always continues to diligently work and follow all investigative leads towards the service of justice,"" the agency said in a written statement.
Indeed, the agency appears to be building a different case against a former Taylor henchman that may include the killing of the sisters.
In May, the agency arrested Tom Woewiyu, Taylor's former Defense Minister. Woewiyu, who has long maintained residence in the United States, was charged with lying on an application for citizenship.
Several months later, the order of nuns contacted the FBI to inquire about the case. Jennifer Lohmeier, an FBI agent, told the order that the agency hoped to file broader human rights charges against Woewiyu that would include the murder of the five sisters.
Cheryl Wittenauer, spokeswoman for the order, also known as the ASC, summarized her conversation with Lohmeier in an email soon after the two spoke by phone this August.
""Apparently, Woewiyu did not give the order to kill the ASC sisters, but he is implicated in that the killings were accomplished under his command,"" Wittenauer wrote to her supervisors, according to an email obtained by ProPublica and Frontline.
Lohmeier did not return calls for comment. The FBI said they would neither confirm nor deny information regarding Woewiyu's case since it is an open investigation.
However, the press release announcing Woewiyu's capture is headlined: ""Alleged War Criminal Arrested."" (No known judicial or police authority to date has made such an allegation)
The indictment against him on U.S. immigration violations contains a long history of Woewiyu's role in Liberia's history and civil war. It notes that when Woewiyu was Taylor's minister of defense, Taylor's forces conducted a campaign ""characterized by the torture of perceived adversaries, the execution of civilians, the killing of ECOMOG peacekeepers, the forced sexual slavery and rape of girls and women, the conscription of child soldiers, and the murder of humanitarian aid workers"" -- incongruously strong stuff for an indictment based upon allegations of perjury on Immigration and Naturalization Service Form N-400.
Through his wife, Woewiyu declined comment.
In Liberia, the murder of the sisters became a footnote in a story that grew ever more savage. The war became a hydra, with Taylor's forces one among many rebel groups fighting to control the country.
 

Taylor was elected president in 1997. The peace that followed was temporary, and the country soon plunged back into a civil war. All told, some 200,000 Liberians were believed killed in the 14 years of conflict. Half of the country's population of 3 million had been displaced. In the years that followed, Liberia never made peace with its violent past. Charles Taylor was convicted in international court for crimes he committed in neighboring Sierra Leone, not Liberia. The Liberian Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended sanctions for scores of people that committed crimes during the conflict -- including Vambo. They were never carried out. The current government has not made punishment a priority. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize winner elected in 2005, campaigned on a promise to ""forgive, not forget."" In an interview with ProPublica and Frontline, Sirleaf said that her government stood ready to charge any individual with war crimes -- though the fact is that today, nobody sits in a Liberian prison for the atrocities wreaked upon Liberia and its people. Sirleaf said that her government had recognized the sisters for ""their bravery."" She said her critics have overemphasized the importance of punishment in the reconciliation of the country. ""If we were to go fishing for everything that happened before this government, all of our time would be spent doing that and not moving the country forward,"" Sirleaf said. For his part, Rose said he has not given up on justice someday, somewhere for the sisters. At 85, walking slowly with a cane, he's hobbled by time, but enlivened by his cause. He describes himself as ""unfulfilled and angry."" ""I don't think many American people remember that there were five American citizens killed during the Liberian war. Nor do I think many know that the person who killed three of them was identified and that the FBI made a case and presented the case,"" Rose said. ""I think if the American people were aware of that, they too would feel that justice was not done."" Abel Welwean contributed to this report.

31 December 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"31 December 2014 12:03 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2014 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Lagos, Dec 31, 2014 (Daily Independent/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- If anything else the Nigerian child in the outgoing year 2014 suffered the most as it became object of attacks and neglect at the home front, in the neighourhood, within and outside the school environment, and prisoner of political struggles.
With the shocking revelation from The United Nations International Children Education Fund (UNICEF) that Nigeria has 10.5 million out of school children, representing about 47 per cent of the global figure worldwide, has continued to give course for concern to the international organisation.
UNICEF Planning Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, Dr. Danjuma Almustafa, who represented Chief of Field Office, UNICEF Bauchi, Dr. Abdulai Kaikai, lamented that almost one of three primary school children was out of school, and roughly one of four junior secondary school children was out of school.
UNICEF stated that with nearly 6.3 million or 60 per cent, of the 10.5 million Nigerian children who out of school children live in the northern part of the country, the situation got worse with deliberate attacks on learning infrastructure by the Insurgent Boko Haram.
The destruction of school attended by the few children in the north east that initially attacked at night since the previous years when schools were empty soon shifted to daylight attacks where teachers and school students are increasingly targeted by militants, resulting in killings, and abductions.
Climax of the insurgents attack on educational facilities in the north was the abduction of over 200 girls since April this year and subsequent destruction of schools through bombings and use of young girls of school as suicide bombers.
According to the umbrella body of teachers in Nigeria, Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) claimed it had lost over 70 of its members to the insurgents and insecurity in schools.
Attacks by the Boko Haram sect resulted in the huge losses in both human and materials in the most affected states of Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe.
As schools were forced to close down, many students whose parents were displaced as a result of the incessant attacks on learning facilities in these states have migrated to other parts of the country and outside the country where they are presently taking refuge. This had put a wedge in the rights of several thousands of children's access to quality education.
Observers have observed that this year is about the bloodiest year in the history of education in the country.
The abduction of the girls and seeming failure of the Nigerian government to secure release till date generated widespread and global condemnations. This also resulted in series of coordinated protests staged in many states of the federation and Abuja to mount pressure on government to ensure the safe of the girls. With just a few alleged to have escaped from their captors in the Sambisa forest making it home, scores still being held hostage while many have also been added to the number recently.
However, hope of a possible release of the girls following a ceasefire announced by the Federal government was cut short by the sect as it launched fresh attacks on targets in Borno state.
Eight months after the abduction, one of the conveners of the Bring Back our Girls campaign and former education minister, Dr. Obiageli Ezekwesili has stated that government has done very little to ensure the rescue of the girls.
Ezekwesili at a protest in Abuja decried the attitude of the government especially whenever the issue of the girls is raised, adding that the Chibok girls' abduction is still being mentioned in official circles occasionally
 

because of the bring back our girls campaigns group and its determination not to allow the issue of the girls to be swept under the carpet.
""From the attitude of government, it is clear that there is nothing tangible going on. Just observe the way the government acts when the issue of the girls is brought up. The way they reply to questions about the girls shows they have already folded their mats but we will continue. We have not folded our mats. We will continue to stand for the girls.
""Silence can never be an option for us as we continue this advocacy. We will continue to stand.
We have to continue to be the voice of the girls. The New Year marks a completely new chapter for this group. We need to enter the first chapter of the year in a remarkable way,"" she said.
In the same vein no fewer than 48 other students were killed at Potiskum, in Yobe state. The explosion which occurred while the students had gathered for morning assembly left various students killed while some sustained various degrees of injuries.
However, this has contributed in no small measure to the outrageous number of the Nigerian out of school children.
Failure in WASSCE, GCE
When the result of the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) May/June was released only 31.28 per cent of the candidates had six credits including English and Mathematics.
According to the Head of National Office (HNO), Yaba, Lagos, Mr. Charles Eguridu a total of 529,425 candidates representing 31.28 per cent obtained credits in five subjects and above including English Language and Mathematics.
The result when compared to the 2012 and 2013 May/June WASSCE diet, recorded a marginal decline in the performance of candidates against the 38.81 and 36.57 per cent pass that were recorded in 2012 and 2013 respectively.
Also in the November/December diet of the examination only 29.37 per cent obtained credits in five subjects and above including English language and mathematics.
Displease by the dismal and declining performance of students in terminal examinations, a group, Education Right Campaign (ERC), in a statement signed by its National Coordinator and the National Secretary of the group, Taiwo Soweto and Michael Ogundele respectively, stated that government at all levels have jointly pursued a relentless policy of starving public education of funds such that public secondary and primary schools across the country have become devastated with little or no teaching infrastructures such that no useful learning are taking place.
The group puts blame for the failure on the Federal Government as well as state governors, saying that the anti-poor education policies have mortgaged the future of the nation's youths.
""We place the blame for this failure on the shoulders of the President Jonathan Federal Government as well as the State Governors whose anti-poor education policies are mortgaging the future of the Nation's youth.
""If President Jonathan government is serious about education, this recurrent mass failure should serve as a wakeup call to inject more public funds, starting with the UNESCO recommendation of at least 26 per cent of annual budget, into rehabilitating public schools and providing all the required facilities and infrastructures required in a 21st century education sector.
Ebola Virus Disease
Another event that shook the nation was the outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).
The EVD was imported into Nigeria by a Liberian, the late Patrick Sawyer, on July 20, through the Lagos airport and later died in a private hospital, along with some medical staff that treated him at hospital in Obalende area of Lagos State.
For the first time in the history of Nigeria, all hands were on deck to fight the virus and on Monday, October 20, the country was certified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) after 42 days of no incidence of the disease in the country.
This outbreak of the disease during the year set workers union, teachers unions, parents and other pressure groups on collision course with the Federal Government over the safety of students, teachers and other non-teacher staff in schools.  

The result of the face off by the interest groups resulted in the postponement of resumption date for both primary and secondary schools throughout the nation. Against the background of precautionary concerns for the health of Nigeria's teeming schooling population, in the wake of the hanging threat of Ebola Virus, and the need to save the school system or calendar from collapse, stakeholders remain divided for some weeks over the resumption of schools across the country. While proprietors and teachers in the private education sector are largely calling for resumption of schools on September 22, principals and teachers in the public schools system consider the September resumption date hasty and not in the interest of the health of Nigeria's children. Furthermore, beyond the issue of date for schools resumption, concerned stakeholders expressed worries over the poor state of sanitation in many public schools, un-hygienic toilets and the widespread practice of open defecation that constitutes high risk factors for spread of not only Ebola but other diseases like Cholera and diarrhea. Organisations like the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Trades Union Congress (TUC), Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) and the All Nigeria Confederation of Principals of Secondary Schools (ANCONPPS) believe that time is not yet ripe for schools' resumption, as there was no visible or convincing evidence that effective preventive measures or preparations are in place to ensure the health of pupils and students. The resultant effect on the school calendar is the adjustment in resumption that forced school children to rush over unfinished work and short holiday period for pupils and student to freshen up after the end of year break.","2014 - Deprivation, Agonies of the Nigerian Child to Basic Education

31 December 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"31 December 2014 The Wall Street Journal Asia AWSJ 14 English Copyright  2014 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. [From the rise of a brutal terrorist group in the Middle East to the Republicans' sweep of the midterm elections in the U.S., the past year brought a number of game-changing news developments. Among them were the Ebola outbreak, the police shooting in Ferguson, Mo., the Ukraine crisis and the drop in oil prices.]
Oil Prices Decline Sharply,
Weighed Down by U.S. Shale
Oil prices fell by nearly 50% in the second half of 2014 as a flood of crude from U.S. shale disrupted the global oil market. The price drop came on the heels of several years of relative calm in world-wide crude markets, where the rising output in America was balanced by growing oil demand around the globe.
U.S. oil prices began the year above $90 a barrel and rose slowly through the spring; the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude, the oil benchmark in the U.S., peaked at $107 in June. At about the same time, the European benchmark peaked at $115 a barrel.
Then prices began to fall. While the supply was robust, the global thirst for crude oil slackened. Amid cooling prices and weakening demand, U.S. shale drillers kept charging ahead. The U.S.'s big three oil fields began the year pumping 3.67 million barrels a day. By year's end, it was 4.69 million barrels a day and rising, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. American oil displaced imports, putting pressure on countries like Nigeria and Colombia that had traditionally sold a lot of their oil to American refineries.
Over the summer, two things happened that reshaped the energy picture. The U.S. was beginning to export a certain kind of unrefined oil, a crack in an export ban on crude that dates back to the 1970s Arab oil embargo. While the number of barrels involved was small, the decision jolted the market. A week after the U.S. move, Libya reopened two large oil-export terminals, adding new crude supplies.
Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia met in November to discuss cutting production. Russia balked. Two days after the meeting, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided not to cut either. Prices fell further, dropping into the mid-$50s range for U.S. crude. European crude oil briefly dropped below $60 a barrel, then edged back up to about $62 a barrel. Through late December, American oil output continued to grow.
The drop in crude prices was a boon to drivers, who filled up their tanks with gasoline bought at the lowest prices in five years. The economies of major crude producers, such as Russia, were walloped.

Ukraine Explodes
Into Military Conflict
The political tug of war over Ukraine exploded into a military conflict that has killed thousands of people, including 298 aboard a commercial jetliner shot down in rebel territory. Relations between Russia and the West sank to a post-Cold War low as economic sanctions piled up.
The conflict grew out of street protests against Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych's pivot toward Russia. The president fled in February; within a month, Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula.
The U.S., European Union and others denounced Russia's move as an illegal land grab and responded with asset freezes, travel bans and diplomatic snubs. But the conflict spread to Ukraine's east, an industrial, predominantly Russian-speaking region. Separatist militias took form, declaring ""people's republics"" and sometimes humiliating poorly equipped Ukrainian soldiers.
 

In May, confectionery tycoon Petro Poroshenko was elected president, promising to rout the rebels and turn Ukraine back toward Europe. He began an all-out military operation in July, recapturing lost ground with airstrikes and heavy artillery.
The West hit Russia's financial, defense and energy sectors with sanctions days after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in eastern Ukraine on July 17. In August, advancing government forces were sent reeling by an influx of Russian armor and troops.
A peace plan signed Sept. 5 seemingly leaves in place the rebel gains, creating another frozen conflict that allows the Kremlin to maintain its influence over a former Soviet republic. Days later, Ukraine agreed to delay part of a trade deal with Europe opposed by Moscow by more than a year. Hundreds of deaths have been recorded since the Sept. 5 truce, bringing the total to more than 4,300, according to the U.N.
Russia's economy and currency were hit hard by the crisis, prompting its central bank to raise its key interest rate to 17% in December in a bid to stem the ruble's drop. The government warned the country would slip into recession next year.

Ferguson Shooting Puts U.S.
Police Tactics in Spotlight
The shooting death of an 18-year-old unarmed black man by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., in August set off peaceful demonstrations that eventually turned into nights of riots in the St. Louis suburb.
The incident quickly morphed into a national debate over protests of alleged mistreatment of African-Americans by police and a criminal-justice system that declined to indict the officers involved.
The story took another violent turn just before Christmas, when two New York City police officers were gunned down by a lone assailant who had left posts on social media saying he was inspired by the Ferguson shooting and the police killing of another unarmed black man in New York.
President Barack Obama said he supported peaceful protests and authorized a federal investigation into the Ferguson police department and Michael Brown's death.
""There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting,"" the president said. ""There's also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests.""
In Ferguson, the protests reignited in late November with more riots after a grand jury declined to indict the officer involved in the August shooting.
By December, the deaths of the two officers in New York prompted some law-enforcement officials to turn against politicians they accused of recklessly supporting protesters.

Ebola Outbreak Becomes
A Global Health Crisis
The Ebola virus ravaged West Africa, leaving more than 7,500 people dead, raising global concerns and taking a toll on the continent's burgeoning economies.
The outbreak of the viral hemorrhagic disease devastated Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, developing nations already burdened by civil unrest and crushing poverty. Poor health infrastructure and planning, the international community's slow initial response, local resistance to outside assistance and corruptionin the early stages exacerbated the crisis.
Aid organizations warned that amassing a medical workforce would be a huge challenge. Still, nations such as Nigeria acted quickly and were able to contain the virus, while others showed they have built strong defenses to cut off potential outbreaks.
Health workers who helped treat patients in West Africa faced heavy risks, and some transported the disease beyond the continent. A nursing aide in Spain who contracted the first case outside Africa recovered, but authorities put down her family's dog amid an outcry.
 

Two missionaries who were evacuated to the U.S. from Liberia survived the disease, but a Liberian man who flew to the U.S. died of Ebola at a Dallas hospital, prompting concern about the country's readiness in the event the disease spread. Later, a surgeon who contracted the disease in Sierra Leone died in Nebraska.
The U.S. sent the military to West Africa, while the Obama administration grappled with imposing travel bans and lobbied Congress for emergency funds to fight the virus.
The cases of a doctor who recovered in New York and a nurse who was quarantined in New Jersey, then defied such restrictions, raised public consciousness in the U.S. Heavy U.S. demand for protective gear sparked shortages in Africa.
The lack of a proven drug or vaccine stymied efforts to quell the outbreak, but vaccine makers moved up clinical trials. In West Africa, researchers are studying a more accessible product: the blood of survivors.

Cyberattack on Sony
Is Traced to North Korea
The cyberattack that hit Sony Pictures Entertainment in late November began as a salacious peek at the inner workings of Hollywood, as hackers released the emails of top executives, including Co-Chairman Amy Pascal and Chief Executive Michael Lynton.
The hackers' purported motive: retaliation against the studio for ""The Interview,"" a comedy film about two television journalists tasked with assassinating North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
But the incident quickly escalated into an international controversy, after hackers threatened violence against theaters that played the film, and U.S. officials concluded that North Korea was behind the broad cyberattack on the company. The Sony Corp. studio made an 11th-hour decision to cancel the movie's Dec. 25 release.
That move was met with considerable backlash in Hollywood and Washington, where President Barack Obama called the decision a mistake. Then, two days before Christmas, Sony announced it would release the film as part of a limited theatrical run, with a simultaneous video-on-demand offering. Possibly as a result of the controversy, crowds flocked to see it in theaters, ringing up just over $1 million in ticket sales on the first day. Online, the movie was rented or bought more than two million times in its first four days, generating more than $15 million in gross revenue.
Sony is still working to figure out when and how to release the film internationally; now it is available only in the U.S. In Hollywood, the scandal had an immediate chilling effect on other projects in development pertaining to North Korea. More broadly, the incident raised concerns that other companies' systems could be vulnerable to malicious hacking.

Big Asian Economies
Face Uncertainty
China is on track to miss its 2014 annual growth target of 7.5%, the most dramatic example of Asian countries -- including Japan, India and Indonesia -- where leaders are trying to find their footing in the face of economic headwinds.
Beijing has been attempting to wean the world's second-largest economy off risky credit, let some air out of a property bubble without causing a pop, and steer the nation toward an era of lower and more sustainable growth. Chinese authorities have been cautious, but investors are jittery. The People's Bank of China in November cut interest rates for the first time in two years in an effort to bolster growth amid a fast slowdown in housing sales. A modest tightening in December to lending rules sparked the biggest daily loss in five years on Shanghai's stock market.
Japan, meanwhile, doubled down on a bid to end years of falling prices and subpar growth. In October, the Bank of Japan expanded its asset purchases by trillions of yen. But Japan also is the most indebted developed nation. That has forced it to raise taxes alongside stimulus, tipping the nation into recession in the third quarter.
The BOJ forecasts the economy will grow an anemic 0.5% in the fiscal year ending in March, but that activity will pick up the following year.
 

There was some hope in 2014 around India and Indonesia, two large economies that both got new leaders this year. Business-friendly changes in both places could attract investment. Both nations in 2014 maintained a tight monetary policy, shoring up their defenses for such an event, as well as battling inflation.
Asia's largest economies ended 2014 with a great deal of uncertainty over the horizon.

Big Banks Face Tough
Regulatory Oversight
When six banks agreed to pay a whopping $4.3 billion in November on charges they had manipulated foreign-exchange rates, the settlements had elements of what have come to be the hallmarks of bank regulation this year. Several regulators -- in this case from the U.S., U.K. and Switzerland -- cooperated in the action; the fines were very big; and the orders included quotes from embarrassing emails in which traders discussed their actions in colorful detail.
But in one of the more significant signs of the tough approach regulators took in many instances, the banks were forced to provide a lot more than penalty money. They had to agree to intrusive and highly detailed instructions on what they needed to do to remedy the behaviors. And these weren't one-off changes. There is a continuing role for regulators to monitor the banks and ensure new systems are put in place to prevent recurrences. The banks will be watched carefully for any slips.
Regulators don't expect that oversight to let up. Fines will be important, but more important will be measures intended to correct shortcomings in banking culture.
Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York state's Department of Financial Services, said regulators now want to remove people involved in violations and install monitors to continue to probe inside the banks. ""It's often not huge fines that get you where you want to get,"" he said.
The banking industry hasn't taken to the enforcement actions lying down, complaining of overly severe penalties. While banks have agreed to the actions in the individual cases, they have argued that the penalties are often higher than justified by the infractions.

Tentative Thaw in Relations
Between U.S. and Cuba
President Barack Obama, acting without Congress, in December said he would move to re-establish diplomatic ties with Cuba after more than five decades of open antagonism.
Mr. Obama made a surprise announcement that the U.S. would normalize relations with the ruling communist regime for the first time since Dwight D. Eisenhower was president.
In addition to saying it would establish an embassy in Havana, the Obama administration said it would allow U.S. financial institutions to do business in Cuba, permit greater trade and increase the amount of money that Americans can send to relatives on the island.
""If you've done the same thing for 50 years and nothing has changed, you should try something different if you want a different outcome,"" Mr. Obama said.
The U.S. trade embargo remains in place, as it can be rescinded only by Congress. Mr. Obama's new direction was sharply opposed by critics who said the Cuban regime shouldn't be rewarded or legitimized due to its record on human rights and democracy.
""This is a reward that a totalitarian regime does not deserve, and this announcement only perpetuates the Castro regime's decades of repression,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat and departing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Flurry of Inversion Deals
Before Crackdown
 

Sometimes it pays to be early. That was the case in the 2014, when companies rushed to strike deals that would allow them to move overseas and lower their taxes -- often dramatically so. A U.S. government crackdown on so-called inversions turned away some latecomers. But several early adopters came in under the wire and gained a potential longer-term edge over their rivals in the process.
Many of those early birds were health-care companies looking to shield overseas cash from U.S. tax rates. Over half of the more-than-$648 billion of the health-care deals announced (although not necessarily completed) in 2014 were inversions, according to data provider Dealogic.
The trend gained momentum in the spring, when Pfizer Inc. tried to buy AstraZeneca PLC in a $120 billion deal that would have moved the New Jersey pharmaceutical giant for tax purposes to the U.K. Though that deal didn't get done, it got Washington's attention. Concerns raised about the potential deal were among the factors that spurred the Obama administration to begin examining ways to curb the practice, a senior administration official said earlier in the year.
The Treasury Department stepped in a few weeks later, announcing new rules that made the deals less lucrative. The rules, announced Sept. 22, had a chilling effect on deals that hadn't closed. The biggest known casualty: AbbVie Inc.'s $54 billion deal to buy Shire PLC, which was called off in October.

Israel, Hamas Clash
In Deadly Conflict
Six weeks after the breakdown of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Israel and the Islamist group Hamas fought their third and deadliest war in five years.
The sparks came from the abduction and killing of three Israeli teens in the West Bank on June 12 and the retaliatory killing of a Palestinian teen on July 2, amid a rise in rocket fire into Israel from militants in the Gaza Strip.
Israel launched an air campaign against rocket-launch sites and other Hamas targets in the enclave, including tunnels under the border, and sent in ground troops. Early efforts at diplomacy yielded short pauses in fighting, but little more.
Some Israeli attacks caused high civilian casualties despite Israel's insistence that it took precautions to avoid them, blaming Hamas for using human shields. Palestinian deaths in the conflict were estimated at more than 2,100, and Israel reported the deaths of about 70 people.
While Israel drew international condemnation for the severity of destruction it caused, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was blasted at home for not going far enough.
An Aug. 26 Egypt-brokered cease-fire restored the status quo, with both sides claiming victory after the 50-day war. The calm was broken in late December, when a rocket and sniper fire from Gaza spurred Israeli airstrikes.

Obama Takes Action
On Illegal Immigrants
A surge in illegal entries of unaccompanied children and families into the U.S. spawned a political crisis that undermined bilateral support for a comprehensive overhaul of the country's immigration system.
Ultimately, President Barack Obama decided to use his executive powers to shield from deportation as many as five million of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S., setting the stage for a protracted battle over the issue next year.
Nearly 69,000 unaccompanied children, mainly from Central America, streamed across the border in the year ended Sept. 30, a 77% increase from 2013. Roughly as many migrants, typically mothers and children, came in family units, a 360% jump over the previous year. The influx peaked over the summer, then dropped sharply.
Many migrants said they were fleeing violence and have requested asylum. After being apprehended at the border, most minors were processed by U.S. authorities and released to relatives or friends while they await deportation proceedings. Many families remain in detention near the border. Due to a shortage of space, some of them were allowed to join relatives in the U.S. while their removal cases unfold in immigration court.  

The Obama administration's decision to expedite their deportation cases angered immigrant advocates. At the same time, the surge hardened the positions of Republicans who said it underscored the need to bolster border security before Congress passes laws to legalize undocumented immigrants already in the U.S.
After November's midterm elections, Mr. Obama announced executive action to temporarily protect millions of immigrants from deportation and give them work authorization. He had earlier promised to tackle immigration unilaterally in the absence of congressional action. Republicans said the unilateral action exceeded the president's legal authority and vowed to block it. Top leaders in some 20 states have sued him over the plan but experts differ on whether they have a case.

General Motors Is Dogged
By Recalls, Probes
Mary Barra began her first year running General Motors Co. with the wind at her back. Armed with a fortress balance sheet and North American margins on a positive swing, she was among President Barack Obama's guests at the State of the Union in January.
Then the auto maker ran into one of the biggest challenges in its 106-year-history, forcing Ms. Barra, 53 years old, to return to Washington several times to explain to lawmakers and regulators why it was so slow in addressing the faulty ignition switches installed in vehicles for a decade. The safety crisis led to millions of recalls and will cost the Detroit auto giant billions of dollars to resolve.
GM's management team moved quickly to identify blame and repair affected vehicles -- primarily small cars like the Chevrolet Cobalt. But the incident raised fresh questions about a company that had just a few years earlier filed for bankruptcy protection and relied on a government bailout to regain viability.
Among the moves Ms. Barra made: appointing Chicago attorney Anton Valukas. Interviewing hundreds of witnesses, he compiled a 315-page report documenting a decadelong odyssey during which GM showed a lack of urgency in addressing its ignition-switch problems. GM also appointed attorney Kenneth Feinberg as the independent custodian of a compensation fund.
GM is subject to a Justice Department investigation that analysts estimate could end with a fine of at least $2 billion. The auto maker also faces class-action lawsuits.
Ms. Barra is trying to move on, focusing on the company's financial goals and attempts to fix GM Europe, revive Cadillac and mend relations with suppliers. The industry, however, continues to confront safety questions, mostly related to a Takata Corp. air-bag recall involving about 10 auto makers and more than 13 million cars and trucks globally.

Malaysia Airlines Plane
Mysteriously Disappears
On the night of March 8, Malaysia Airlines flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. More than nine months later, their fate remains a mystery.
A frantic search for the Boeing 777 began in the Gulf of Thailand, not far from where the plane fell off radar screens about an hour into the flight to Beijing. Days later, after investigators had analyzed satellite transmissions, the search expanded by thousands of miles, in an air and sea operation of unprecedented scale.
Investigators believe the plane was deliberately diverted by someone with deep technical knowledge of the aircraft. No suspects or suspected motives have emerged.
As investigators continued to refine their analysis of the so-called digital handshakes between the plane and an Inmarsat PLC satellite, they narrowed the search area to a vast stretch of sea far off the coast of western Australia, where they suspect the plane crashed after running out of fuel.

Turkey's Leader Erdogan
Asserts His Power
 

For Turkey, 2014 was marked by volatility, foreign-policy friction and the political triumph of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose consolidation of power divided the nation and alarmed Western allies.
The year began with Mr. Erdogan, then prime minister, confronting one of the gravest threats to him in his nearly 12 years as a Turkish leader. He broke ranks with conservative allies and faced a corruption scandal that ensnared dozens of his allies.
Amid a series of allegations of government graft, Turkey's currency tumbled, forcing the central bank into an emergency rate increase.
Mr. Erdogan overcome the allegations and clinched the presidency in August, after casting his former allies as terrorist coup-plotters, briefly blocking YouTube and Twitter, and cracking down on street protests. Through the year he tightened his grip with changes to the justice system, media and security services.
Turkey also locked horns with U.S. and European allies over foreign policy, spotlighting friction over conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and how to combat Islamic State extremists. After a diplomatic effort by U.S. and European officials in the fall, Mr. Erdogan ramped up border security but refused to open air bases for airstrikes against Islamic State.
As the year drew to a close, friction with allies was again exposed with the arrests of 27 people on charges of coup-plotting. Amid stern rebukes from Western capitals, Mr. Erdogan told his detractors to ""mind their own business.""

Chinese Firm Alibaba's IPO
Is Biggest in History
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. set a new bar for initial public offerings with its $25 billion U.S. listing on Sept. 18. The biggest IPO in history gave the Chinese e-commerce company a market value bigger than U.S. giant Amazon.com Inc.
The deal also delivered a 38% first-day trading gain for investors who bought in, and generated some $300 million for its underwriters. Many big hedge funds, including Paulson & Co., said that gains on the deal helped them turn a volatile quarter into a strong one.
With Alibaba's proceeds, the U.S. market saw more money raised by IPOs than in any year since the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, according to Dealogic. Increased investor interest in China's Internet economy helped others list in the U.S. this year, including online shopping rival JD.com Inc., which raised $2 billion in a New York listing, and Chinese mobile-chat app makers Weibo Corp. and Momo Inc., who both count Alibaba as a strategic investor.
Alibaba says it has more than 275 million active buyers in its Chinese retail sites -- or roughly 90% of the country's online shoppers -- who generated some $300 billion in transactions. Executive Chairman Jack Ma, who founded the firm in 1999, attracted global media attention as he toured to meet investors. The IPO solidified his position as China's richest man.

U.S. Health Law Smoother,
But Hurdles Remain
The Affordable Care Act recovered from its initial stumbles only to face a host of fresh challenges.
About 6.4 million people selected a plan or were automatically re-enrolled on HealthCare.gov between Nov. 15 and Dec. 19, federal officials said. The site hasn't experienced the widespread crashes that hobbled the law's first year of enrollment.
The U.S. had 10.6 million fewer uninsured people in September than a year earlier -- a drop of 30%, according to the Urban Institute. But problems still dogged the law this year.
In June, the Obama administration lost a Supreme Court challenge to the law's requirement that health plans cover contraception. By November, the high court had agreed to hear another case against the law. At stake are subsidies that make plans cheaper for millions of consumers.
 

Despite this year's relatively smooth enrollment, the administration has lowered projections for how many people it expects to sign up for private coverage in 2015 -- expecting 9.9 million, compared with 13 million projected by the Congressional Budget Office. -- Stephanie Armour License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service",The Year in Review: 2014,The Wall Street Journal Asia AWSJ

Dec 29, 2014 (Leadership/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The year 2014 has been regarded as a year of pain, tragic deaths, destruction high level of bloodshed and high wire politicking, being the year before the general elections. Job seekers lost their lives while seeking to be gainfully employed in the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), over 200 schoolgirls were abducted and some of them are still being held captive as you read this, female suicide bombers including teenagers joined the ranks of Boko Haram insurgents and life was threatened by the Ebola virus disease but in the midst of all this negativism, there were still some positives with the successful hosting of the national conference, celebration of the country's centennial and the feats by the nation's athletes. We bring you some of those moments.
Immigration job tragedy
One memory of 2014 which will not fade hurriedly is the loss of at least 19 job seekers in the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) recruitment exercise. The unfortunate applicants who lost their lives were some of the 6.5 million Nigerians who thronged various centres across the country, each aiming to get one of the 4,000 job slots advertised by the NIS, after parting with N1,000 application fees. Many other applicants also sustained various degrees of injuries in the stampede at the recruitment centres. In the wake of the incident, the federal government and the National Assembly constituted panels to investigate the tragedy and though the various panels completed their investigations and submitted reports, the findings are yet to be made public. This is just as job slots promised to families of the deceased applicants as well as survivors who sustained injuries are yet to be delivered.
'Missing' $20 billion oil money
In the economy, the inability of the federal government to convincingly explain and clear the air on the alleged missing $20 billion being unremitted revenue from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) after former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Malam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi raised the alarm when he appeared before the Senate Committee on Finance has been rated as a major loss this year. Though the government through the Coordinating Minister of the Economy and Minister of Finance Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala offered some explanations, Nigerians as well as the whistle-blower found it unsatisfactory
Abduction of Chibok Schoolgirls
In a move that stirred global outrage, members of the Boho Haram sect in one of their most brazen attacks of 2014, stormed Government Secondary Secondary School Chibok, Borno State, where over 200 girls sitting for the Senior School Certificate Examinations (SSCE) were abducted. Though about 56 of the girls later escaped from their abductors, more than 200 of them are still in captivity more than eight months after they were whisked away and the government has been severally accused of not living up to its promise of ensuring the safe release of the girls.
Ebola virus disease berths in Nigeria
Nigerians woke on July 20, 2014 to the news that the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) had berthed on the shores of the country, in Lagos. American-Liberian, Patrick Sawyer said to be the one who ferried the disease into the country, was visiting Lagos from Monrovia when he was found to be ill and upon medical examination, was found to be infected with the Ebola virus. The virus was however, successfully contained after about 93 days but not before 19 people had been infected with it, out of which seven died while 12, survived.
Death of Ebola 'warriors'
One occurrence that dealt a hard blow to many Nigerians was the death of Dr. Stella Adadevoh, Nurse Justina Ejelonu and other medical practitioners who came in contact with the index EVD case and other victims while treating them. Dr Adadevoh would be remembered as the one who through her insistence that
 

American-Liberian, Patrick Sawyer, reported to have been the one who brought the EVD to Nigeria, does not leave First Consultant Hospital, Lagos, where she worked as a lead consultant and he was being treated for the virus, does not leave the hospital, saved many Nigerians who would have come in contact with him had he left, as he was said to have requested that the hospital discharges him to enable him attend a conference in Calabar, Cross River State.
Rise in insurgency
Islamist insurgents, Boko Haram appear to have become more emboldened this year, killing and maiming at will. The number of insurgents' attacks and deaths recorded from them this year is perhaps the highest in the history of insurgency in the country. From January to December, it has been bombs, guns, blood and more bombs. In one attack by the sect in Gamboru Ngala town in May, at least 336 people were killed. There was also a rise in bomb blasts but was even more worrisome was the conscription of young females as suicide bombers, many of who carried out suicide bomb attacks in Kano, Maiduguri and Bauchi at different times, killing and injuring countless numbers of persons. As a consequence, there has been an exponential rise in the number of internally displaced persons. Nigeria now leads Africa's list of persons displaced by conflict, with the number of her internally displaced persons (IDPs) pegged at 3.3 million.
Capturing of territories by insurgents
In the outgoing year, apparently banking on the successes recorded in its various vicious attacks, insurgents, Boko Haram took their threats of Islamising Nigeria seriously when they attacked and captured villages in the north-eastern part of the country, renaming and declaring them caliphates Gwoza in Borno State was captured and renamed 'Darul Hikma.' Banki, Marte, Konduga, Gambaru Ngala, Dikwa, Bama, Gwoza and Lassa towns all in Borno State were also captured by the insurgents. Mubi a commercial town and second largest in in Adamawa State, after the state capital, was renamed 'Madinatul Islam' after it was captured. Towns including Michika, Madagali, Gombi and Hong were also captured in Adamawa while in Yobe, Bara and Buni-Yadi towns were captured.
Examinations Mass Failure
In education, the year also did not go by without any loses recorded. The result of the West Africa Examination Council (WAEC) May/June 2014 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) released this year, indicated that mass failure was recorded especially in the core subjects, Mathematics and English Language. According to WAEC, only 529,425 candidates, representing 31.28 per cent of those who sat for the examination, obtained credits in five subjects and above, including English Language and Mathematics, showing a decline when compared to the 2012 and 2013 May/June WASSCE results. There was marginal decline in the performance of candidates as 38.81 per cent was recorded in 2012 and 36.57 per cent in 2013. The situation was the same with the private candidate WASSCE where 71 per cent failure was also recorded, this year.
Nigeria crashes out of AFCON qualifier
In November this year, the Super Eagles of Nigeria, the reigning Africa Cup of Nations champions failed in their bid to defend their title in Equatorial Guinea after failing to qualify from Group A. Nigeria ended the run to the 2015 AFCON after the national team, the Super Eagles were held to a 2-2 draw by South Africa in their last match, placing them at eight points. The loss was rued by football lovers who chastised the male national team for their inability to defend the title.
Drop in international oil price
The reason for the fears of Nigerians when the international oil price dropped were not far-fetched. Nigeria operates a mono-economy, depending on oil as its major revenue earner. Price of crude on the international oil market dropped to $77.76 per barrel, below the $78 benchmark earlier proposed to the National Assembly for the 2015 budget. To cushion the effects on the economy, the Federal government announced austerity measures due to the decline in the price of crude oil in the international market. Coordinating Minister for the Economy and Minister of Finance, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala explained that the austerity measures would see Nigerians paying heavier taxes on luxury goods and a reduction in public expenditure as well as international travels by public servants.
Failed ceasefire deal
The government raised the hopes of not a few Nigerians that insurgency in the country would be a thing of the past when it announced on October 17 that it had reached a ceasefire deal with the Boko Haram fighters. Chief of Defence Staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh who announced the deal also ordered immediate withdrawal of all field troops in compliance but barely was he through with the announcement than bombs went off with more in the days that followed, causing Nigerians to doubt the ceasefire. The raised hopes of those who chose to remain optimistic were however dashed in the weeks that followed. Violence by the sect continued  

unabated just as the sect in a video, eventualy denied that there was no ceasefire deal between it and the government.
Prison breaks
The year 2014 appeared to be the year of prison breaks in the country, with the incidents occurring in Lagos, Niger, Kogi and Ekiti among others. After a riot at the Kirikiri Medium Security Prison, Lagos, which was allegedly triggered by the actions of prison officials, one inmate reportedly died while several others sustained injuries. In the Ado Ekiti incident, 435 inmates reportedly escaped from the prison but about 193 of them were later recaptured, according to officials of the Nigeria Prison Service who had initially denied the report, while about 275 prisoners escaped when the Medium Security Prison, Minna, Niger State, was broken. 108 were however re-arrested and brought back to the cell.
Gains
Centenary Celebration
One of the most remarkable events in the history of the country also happened this year. This year, Nigeria marked its centennial anniversary that is 100 years since the northern and southern protectorates were amalgamated by the British. As part of events to mark the anniversary, the federal government held elaborate celebrations and also approved the design of a new commemorative N100 note which went into circulation this month. A centenary city is also undergoing construction in the nation's capital city.
Permanent voters cards
For the first time in the history of the country, the electoral body, Independent National electoral Commission (INEC) successfully produced and beagan the distribution of permanent voters cards across the country. Though the entire exercise of registering and distributing the permanent voters cards was marred with some operational and institutional hitches, it was adjudged by analysts as one step towards ensuring credible elections in the country as the permanent voters cards would check cases of multiple voting by voters.
Ebola free certification by WHO
When the Ebola virus disease berthed in Nigeria, many Nigerians went into panic mode; fears were expressed about the ability of the Nigerian health sector as it currently is, to effectively combat the virus. It was even more worrisome that it started in the most populous city in the country, Lagos. Several Ebola cure claims ranging from consumption of bitter kola to bathing with and drinking hot salty water emerged but in the end, thanks to the brilliance and ingenuity of Nigerian medical personnel, the country effectively contained the virus and was declared Ebola free by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
National conference holds
Not many expected that the promise of President Goodluck Jonathan to convoke a national conference where issues bothering on the unity of the country would be discussed would be met but the promise was met and to the chagrin of those who thought the conference would be a war field where Nigerians would tear themselves apart and not be able to discuss meaningfully, the conference was held successfully, though with some hitches. The implementation of the report of the conference is however still being awaited months after it was submitted.
Recapturing of territories from insurgents
The military also this year recorded remarkable success in the fight against insurgency, especially with the recapturing of some of the towns and villages which had been recaptured by Boko Haram. The military recaptured towns including Mubi, Gombi, Pelia and Hong in Adamawa State as well as Chibok and Gwoza in Borno State among others. Many equipment and ammunition were also recovered from the insurgents while several of them were killed in gun duels with the military. Though some of the territories are still in the control of the insurgents, the war waged against them by the military continues.
Super falcons win AWC
As the saying goes, what a man can do, a woman can do better but in the case of Nigeria this year, it was more of what a man can't do, a woman can do when the Super Falcons of Nigeria won a record seventh African Women's Championship after beating Cameroon 2-0 in the final. Both Nigeria and Cameroon along with third-place winners Cote d'Ivoire will represent Africa in next year's FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada.
Alison-Madueke emerges first female president of OPEC
 

Nigeria's minister of petroleum, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke in November was elected the first female president of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at the 166th General Meeting of the organisation in Vienna, Austria. Alison-Madueke took over from the former president, Abdourhman Atahar Al-Ahirish who hails from Libya. She was the first female to take on the position of Minister of Petroleum resources in Nigeria and also elected the first female president of OPEC. She also emerged first female president of organisation of gas exporting countries in December this year. Nigeria rebases GDP After a 24 year hiatus, Nigeria undertook the rebasing of her Gross Domestic product (GDP) with total nominal GDP ranging from 59.5 per cent. With the rebasing, Nigeria's GDP increased to 89.22 per cent in 2014 and it is now worth N80.2 trillion, or $509.9 billion, rising from its original figure of N42.4 trillion, or $269.5 billion. The rebasing also now ranks Nigeria as the 26th largest economy in the world, and the largest economy in Africa, ahead of South Africa. Statistics from the rebased GDP show that Nigeria's economy is now more diversified, with the agriculture sector contribution declining from 33 per cent to 22 per cent, and services increasing from 26 per cent to 51 per cent; oil & gas 15.9 per cent, manufacturing 6.7 per cent, telecoms 8.7 per cent, entertainment 1.2 per cent. Okagbare wins again and again Blessing Okagbare, Nigeria and Africa's fastest woman brought glory to the country in the outgoing year with the many international awards she clinched this year. Some of Okagbare's began her exploits this year include a win at the 2014 Jamaica International Invitational (IAAF World Challenge meet) held in May, Kingston. In the 100m dash at the competition, she ended with a time of 11.19 seconds ahead of Jamaican duo, Olympian Kerron Stewart and Carrie Russell who made it in 11.32 seconds and 11.46 seconds respectively. Also, at the first Diamond League of the year in Doha, Qatar, she finished second in the 100m dash in a time of 11.18 seconds. At the second Diamond League in Shanghai, Okagbare claimed the long jump title with her first jump of 6.86m to erase the record of 6.73m set by American Janay Deloach Soukup in 2012, while Okagbare won the 200m title in a time of 22.36 seconds to erase the record of 22.37 seconds set by American Allyson Felix in 2009.","2014 Triumphs and Failures

(MENAFN - Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) The United Nations Security Council has extended mandate of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) until September 30, 2015, despite spread of the communicable and deadly disease Ebola in the nation and other countries in western Africa. Unanimously, the UNSC, at a session held late on Monday, adopted resolution 2190, outlining priorities in the areas of civilians' protection, humanitarian assistance support, justice, reforms in security apparatuses, human rights promotion and protection of UN personnel. In details, the resolution stressed that the international peace-keeping force would continue protecting, without prejudice to the primary responsibility of the Liberian authorities, the civilian population from physical violence, within its capabilities and areas of deployment. The Security Council also recognized that the Ebola outbreak has put on hold the joint activities between the Governments of Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire, as well as between the force, UNMIL, and the United Nations Operation in Cote d'Ivoire (UNOCI), and called on these governments to continue reinforcing their cooperation in different areas. Furthermore, the Council decided that UNMIL would have a ""renewed focus"" on supporting the Government in achieving a transition of complete security responsibility to the Liberian National Police, by strengthening its capacity to manage personnel and improve training. It also requested that the UN chief ensure that the Mission has qualified specialized advisers to help implementation of sustainable rule of law, as well as ensuring justice, governance and proceeding with reform programmes. UNMIL, the United Nations Mission in Liberia, is a peace-keeping force, established in September 2003, to monitor a ceasefire agreement in Liberia, following resignation of president Charles Taylor and conclusion of the Second Liberian Civil War. It consisted of up to 15,000 United Nations military personnel and 1,115 police officers, along with a civilian component.",UNSC extends peace-keeping mission's mandate in Liberia,Middle East North Africa Financial Network 
16 December 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"16 December 2014 PNA (Philippines News Agency) PHILNA English (c) 2014 Philippines News Agency UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 16 -- The UN Security Council on Monday extended the mandate of the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) for another nine months until Sept. 30, 2015. In a resolution unanimously adopted here, the 15-nation body decided that UNMIL shall put renewed focus on supporting the government of Liberia to ""achieve a successful transition of complete security responsibility to the LNP (Liberia National Police) by strengthening its capacity, to manage existing personnel and to improve training programs to expedite their readiness to assume security responsibilities throughout Liberia."" The mission will continue to provide, among other tasks, humanitarian assistance and electoral support, as well as human rights promotion and protection. The Council also decided that UNMIL's authorized strength shall remain at up to 4,811 military and 1,795 police personnel. The most powerful body of the UN also reiterated grave concern about the unprecedented extent of the Ebola outbreak in Africa. It recognized that the virus outbreak in Liberia has slowed the efforts of the government to advance certain governance and national reform priorities. Further, the Council emphasized the need for continued progress by the Liberian authorities on ""constitutional and institutional reforms, especially of the rule of law and security sectors, and the national reconciliation processes, particularly in light of the wider political, security, socioeconomic and humanitarian impact of the Ebola outbreak on communities and the need to plan for the longer term recovery of Liberia."" UNMIL was set up in 2003 to bolster a ceasefire agreement after a civil war killed almost 150,000 Liberians -- mostly civilians -- and forced some 850,000 others to flee to neighboring countries.

Dec 15, 2014 (Daily Trust/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Herewith is a list of the 20 most striking controversies which rocked Nigeria in 2014, with some of them being scandals in their own right. Some of the listed controversies will certainly spill into 2015, as they are still unfolding. By no means exhaustive, the list charts the most talked-about incidents that helped shape the past year for better or worse.
'Missing' $20 billion oil money (February 4)
After former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor (now Emir of Kano) Malam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi told the Senate Committee on Finance that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had yet to remit $20bn to government coffers, all hell was let loose. He, in October 2013, lit the fire in a letter to President Goodluck Jonathan, alleging that the NNPC failed to remit about $49.8 billion oil revenue into the Federation Account, saying the said money was missing and needed investigation. He had stated that the NNPC failed since 2012 to account for nearly $50 billion in crude oil sales that should, by law, have been remitted to government coffers through the CBN. Sanusi was dissatisfied with the explanations made by the NNPC authorities over the allegations though he acknowledged that Finance Minister Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala had made some explanations on its whereabouts.
FGN suspends former CBN governor, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi (February 20)
President Jonathan suspended Malam Sanusi Lamido Sanusi as CBN governor, claiming that his tenure had been characterised by acts of financial recklessness and misconduct. The president said he was concerned about far-reaching irregularities under Malam Sanusi's watch, which have distracted the apex bank away from the pursuit and achievement of its statutory mandate. Before his suspension, there had been plans for the ex-CBN governor to go on retirement leave but it was not to be. He however did not exit the financial stage without responding to the 35-count allegations against him by the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria and the federal government.
Minister of Petroleum's N10bn jet expenses (March)
Minister of Petroleum Diezani Alison-Madueke was accused of spending over N10 billion to charter and maintain private jets for her personal use. A resolution by the House of Representatives during plenary blew the cover on the scandal which accused her of spending N130 million monthly to maintain her private jets in two years. The initial accusations were based on suspicions surrounding the source of funding for one private jet, a Challenger 850, before the lawmakers reportedly uncovered another aircraft named Global Express XRS plane. However the NNPC, which Alison-Madueke supervises, denied the allegations, and stated that because oil and gas sector operations are often time-sensitive, it is a standard practice to utilise efficient means of transportation.
19 applicants killed at Immigration Service recruitment exercise (March 15)
Nineteen applicants were killed and scores injured at the 2014 Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) recruitment exercise, a tragedy which occurred when 6.5 million people across the country (including the FCT) stormed various recruitment centres in the country for 4,000 positions. The applicants who had thronged venues of the exercise, mostly stadia, paid N1,000 as application fee. The federal government and the two chambers of the National Assembly constituted separate committees to probe the tragedy at the time, but the reports of the panels are yet to be made public. President Jonathan also promised automatic employment for those 'certified injured' and three slots for immediate family members of those killed, but there are court cases and protests by those affected and civil society organisations over the failure of the government to honour the promises made. Failure to sack Minister of Interior, Comrade Abba Moro, even after taking full responsibility for the tragedy remains controversial.
Abduction of schoolgirls from a Chibok school (April 14)
 

Insurgents infamously stormed a secondary school in Chibok, Borno State, where students were writing their final examinations and abducted over 200 girls. Security forces failed to immediately go after them. Later, leader of the Boko Haram sect, Abubakar Shekau, in a video claimed responsibility, jeering that some of the girls have been married off, while others converted to Islam. The abduction attracted national and international outrage, culminating in protests in some parts of Nigeria and around the world, made popular by the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls. At least 56 of the abducted girls escaped on their own at various times, while the rest are believed to be held by the terrorists in Sambisa Forest. President Jonathan has vowed to have the girls released, but it is 243 days today since the outrageous kidnap.
Impeachment of Murtala Nyako as Adamawa State governor (June 28)
Former governor Murtala Nyako of Adamawa State stirred trouble when he decided to dump the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) for the opposition All Progressives' Congress (APC). He was one of the seven PDP governors that angrily staged a walk-out on the national leader of the party, President Goodluck Jonathan, during a special national convention of the party in Abuja over party leadership crisis. After defecting to the APC, Nyako became critical of his former party and the Jonathan administration. Angered, the Presidency and PDP national leadership allegedly instigated the PDP-dominated 25-member Adamawa State House of Assembly to commence impeachment proceedings against him and his deputy, Bala James Ngilari. On June 28, 2014, the house slammed 20-count charges of gross misconduct and misappropriation of funds on Nyako and a panel set up by the state chief judge, found him guilty of all the charges. Eventually, 18 out of 25 lawmakers signed his impeachment while compelling his deputy to resign.
Sanusi emerges Emir of Kano (June 9)
The intrigues, politics and horse-trading that eventually culminated in the appointment of former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, as the 57th Emir of Kano didn't pass without incident in the state. The whole nation was at a standstill as everyone anxiously awaited the announcement of the new emir. Saturday afternoon, word went out that Sanusi Ado Bayero had been chosen unanimously as the new emir. Even Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, tweeted the decision early Sunday morning and congratulated Bayero but the state governor on the other hand would not accept that verdict. He allegedly pressured the kingmakers even as the state government issued a public denial that Bayero had been chosen. When the kingmakers announced Sanusi Lamido Sanusi as the new emir, a protest by Ciroma's supporters broke out. They took to the streets and marched towards Government House but security operatives calmed them down. Other controversies would follow, like the fact that even after he had been given his staff of office and appointment letter, the new emir was still reported to be receiving guests and well-wishers in the Government House, instead of his palace.
Ebola disease descends on Nigeria (July 20)
American-Liberian, Patrick Sawyer arrived Lagos from Monrovia and it was reported that he looked ""terribly ill"" and was subjected to medical examination in a private hospital in Lagos. His confirmatory test results for Ebola infection were still pending and it eventually proved that Sawyer had Ebola. Former Minister of Health, Prof. Onyebuchi Chukwu, broke the news at a world press conference in Abuja. A lot followed, including burials anywhere in the country requiring a mandatory death certificate. Nigeria's request for an experimental drug was turned down. Several Ebola cure claims ranging from consumption of bitter kola to salt water surfaced and fizzled out. In the end, Nigeria confirmed a total of 19 cases, of whom seven died and 12 survived, hailed as heroes. The country effectively contained the virus, as the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it Ebola-free 42 days after the country's last infectious contact with a confirmed or suspected case. The struggle lasted exactly 93 days.
DHQ Spokesman announces 'rescue' of Chibok girls (16 April)
Director of Defence Information, Major-General Chris Olukolade, announced the rescue of ""all 129 girls"" except eight. The very next day, he retracted the statement to the collective chagrin of Nigerians and the international community. Fast-forward to July, Chief of Defence Staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, said the Nigerian military had discovered where the schoolgirls were being kept, but that they would not use force to rescue them. Badeh was quoted to have said: ""The good news for the girls is that we know where they are but we cannot tell you, we cannot come and tell you military secrets here. Just leave us alone, we are working, we will get the girls back."" But like it was earlier mentioned, it is 243 days today with zero progress on the matter.
Boko Haram announces own 'Caliphate' (August 24)
Boko Haram boldly attacked and captured swathes of territory, renaming them in the process and declaring them part of a 'Caliphate'. Mubi in Adamawa State was renamed 'Madinatul Islam' while Gwoza in Borno was renamed 'Darul Hikma.' Captured towns include Banki, Marte, Konduga, Gambaru Ngala, Dikwa, Bama, Gwoza and Lassa towns in Borno State. In Adamawa States, towns captured include Mubi, Michika,
 

Madagali, Gombi and Hong while in Yobe, Bara and Buni-Yadi towns were captured. Some of them, however, have been recaptured by Nigerian military forces.
First Lady Patience Jonathan publicly doubts Chibok girls' abduction (May 5)
First lady Patience Jonathan at a second enlarged stakeholders' meeting on the abducted schoolgirls openly burst into tears, instantly spawning an internet meme and widely-circulated video in which she kept repeating ""There is God o.'"" Mrs. Jonathan had requested Hajiya Nana Shettima, wife of Borno State governor to chair the committee which sought clarification on conflicting issues on the matter. Mrs. Shettima however did attend the second meeting, to which Mrs. Jonathan complained bitterly. One of the most memorable parts of the video - as well as its lowest point - probably remains when Mrs. Jonathan infamously asked the Chibok school's principal in halting Pidgin English: ""Na only you waka come?""
Thugs' invasion of Ekiti courts (Sept 2014)
In September 2014, political thugs in Ekiti State violently stormed court sessions in separate instances and disrupted proceedings. They beat up judiciary staff as well as a presiding judge, whose clothes were reportedly torn in the process. The high court was hearing the case challenging the eligibility of the then governor-elect, Mr. Ayodele Fayose of the People's Democratic Party (PDP), to contest the June 21 governorship election, which he won. The invasion was prompted by refusal of the presiding judge, Justice Olusegun Ogunyemi to grant an application to set aside an order abridging the time for Fayose to file his defence in the case brought before the court by a member of a socio-cultural group called 'Ekiti-11.' The judge had adjourned the court briefly and as he prepared to return for further hearing of the matter, irate youths besieged the court. On the third day after the first incident, another set of hoodlums violently attacked another Ekiti high court presided over by Justice J.O Adeyeye while his court was hearing an application filed by Ekiti State chapter of the APC. This prompted the Chief Judge, Justice A.S. Daramola, to order immediate closure of all courts in the state. The Ekiti State Commissioner for Justice, Mr Wale Fapohunda, blamed Governor-elect Fayose for the assault, saying he was accompanied to the court premises by a retinue of political thugs. Fayose denied involvement.
IGP withdraws Tambuwal's security over defection to APC (Oct 30)
The Inspector-General of Police (then in acting capacity) Mr. Suleiman Abba ordered the withdrawal of policemen attached to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, two days after he defected to the opposition APC from the PDP.The IGP said since Tambuwal had defected, he could no longer enjoy the privilege of police protection. The Department of State Services (DSS) followed suit. Mr. Abba on November 26 when he appeared before the House Committee on Police Affairs was adamant and refused to recognise Tambuwal as the Speaker of the House of Reps, insisting it would be ""subjudice"" for him to address him as such, as long as the matter was in court. Members of the committee were angry and staged a walk-out.
FG announces slump in oil prices (November 17)
Federal government on the 17th of November announced austerity measures aimed at cushioning its impact on the economy due to the decline in the price of crude oil in the international market. Crude oil prices dropped to $77.76 per barrel, some cents below the $78 benchmark earlier proposed to the National Assembly for the 2015 budget. Coordinating Minister for the Economy and Minister of Finance, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala explained that the austerity measures would see Nigerians paying tax on luxury goods and a reduction in public expenditures and international travels by public servants.
Botched arms deals in South Africa (Sept 2014)
In September, a chartered Bombadier Challenger 600 plane with two Nigerians and an Israeli national onboard ferried $9.3 million to South Africa allegedly for the purchase of arms. But upon landing at the Lanseria International Airport, northwest of Johannesburg, the cargo (money) was apprehended by the South Africa Revenue Service (SARS) which claimed it was smuggled funds. It said the money was not declared and the amount was way beyond ""the prescribed legal limit"" approved by laws of the country. The president Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Pastor Ayo Oritsajafor, admitted ownership of the jet but said: ""I leased the aircraft on August 2, 2014 to a company to run it. It was the leasee that entered into an agreement with the people who carried out the transfer of funds. Having leased the aircraft to the Green Coast Produce Company Limited, any transaction undertaken with the aircraft can no longer be attached to me."" Again, four weeks later, South Africa's Asset Forfeiture Unit of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) seized another $5.7 million meant for another arms deal. The NPA ordered the funds frozen in the bank for allegedly being proceeds of illegal transactions. The controversy is ongoing.
FG announces 'ceasefire deal' with Boko Haram (October 17)
 

On October 17, the federal government announced a ceasefire deal with Boko Haram, sparking hope that the insurgents would release the 276 abducted schoolgirls. It was announced by the Chief of Defence Staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, who said: ""A ceasefire agreement has been concluded between the federal government and Boko Haram."" The President's Principal Secretary, Hassan Tukur, told BBC Focus on Africa that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached after talks with the violent group. Tukur said Boko Haram announced a unilateral ceasefire on Thursday and the government had responded. He said the sect assured that they have the girls unharmed and that they would release them. However, violence by the sect seems to have escalated, with a video of leader Shekau vehemently denying a ceasefire of any sort.
Boko Haram sacks Chief of Defence Staff's country home (Oct 30)
Boko Haram intensified raids on communities in Adamawa State and eventually captured Mubi, the second-largest commercial town in the state. The terrorists attacked the 234 Nigerian Army Battalion, burnt down the police station and broke into Mubi prison, freeing inmates. The insurgents also hoisted their flag at the palace of the emir, having a field day looting and burning. Vintim, a community in Mubi and country home of the Chief of Defence Staff, Alex Badeh, was captured and occupied by the insurgents. The incident provoked outrage from some Nigerians who called for his resignation, which he controversially rejected.
Synagogue building collapse in Lagos (September 12)
A guest house on the premises of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) founded by Pastor TB Joshua in Lagos State collapsed on September 12, 2014. At the time, hundreds of worshippers, most of them South Africans who converged for the annual Signs and Wonders service organised by the church, were present. Pastor Joshua controversially blamed the incident, which killed nearly 118 worshipers, on an unidentified aircraft, which hovered atop the building several times before the collapse. But the Lagos State government said the multi-storey building was not constructed on approved specifications, and that owner of the property had developed it beyond the approved plan. It set up a coroner inquest into the collapsed building. However, Pastor Joshua was reluctant to appear to testify and approached the courts twice in efforts to stop the inquest. The investigation is still in progress.
Lawmakers scale National Assembly gates (November 20)
Chaos broke out at the National Assembly when members were summoned from recess to consider President Goodluck Jonathan's request for the extension of emergency rule in the troubled north-east, but the police attempted to stop House of Reps' speaker, Aminu Tambuwal and other lawmakers from gaining entry into the assembly chambers. This action compelled the legislators who were locked out to scale the gates to access the complex. The ""no entry"" order created pandemonium and chaos, as cops tear-gassed lawmakers, staff and visitors. Police spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu controversially claimed in a statement that the police were acting on 'intelligence reports' of a likely invasion of the House of Reps by hoodlums.
Court discharges Nyanya bomb blast mastermind (Nov 24)
On April 14, a bus station in Nyanya, a surbub of Abuja, was bombed by suspected terrorists. At least 74 people were killed, scores injured and property worth millions of naira destroyed. However, the suspected mastermind of the blast, an army deserter, Aminu Sadiq Ogwuche, reportedly escaped to Sudan. He was a student of Arabic Language at the International University of Africa, Khartoum. The federal government declared him wanted along with others, and through the efforts of Interpol, the Nigeria Police and the Department of State Security Services (DSS), Ogwuche was arrested in Sudan.
Upon extradition to Nigeria on July 15, the Inspector General of Police filed charges of terrorism against Ogwuche at a federal high court in Abuja. But the case suffered several adjournments due to failure of the police to produce the accused, who had been in DSS custody since he was extradited.
The case suffered as the police and the DSS bickered over who had the right to prosecute the suspect. Consequently, Justice Adeniyi Ademola struck out the charges November 24, on grounds of want of diligent prosecution. But the suspect has remained in the custody of the DSS. His decision was compelled by the absence of the legal representative of the IGP in court. The ruling sparked nationwide outrage.
But on December 5, 2014, Ogwuche through an application brought before a federal high court in Abuja by his counsel NureniJimoh is claiming N100 million as damages over his prolonged detention without trial.The court has invited the Attorney General of the Federation to address the constitutional issues raised by Ogwuche challenging alleging violation of his fundamental rights. The case comes up on December 17 for hearing.","Top 20 Controversies That Rocked 2014

Dec 12, 2014 (Liberian Observer/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The UN Security Council on Tuesday renewed the sanctions on Liberia for another nine months since it has determined the situation in the country remains fragile and constitutes a threat to international peace and security in the region.
In a unanimously adopted resolution, the Security Council renewed a set of measures on travel ban and arms embargo for nine months, and also extended the mandate of the panel of experts tasked with monitoring compliance with the measures for ten months, beginning on Tuesday.
The Security Council also expressed in the draft resolution its intent to scale back and terminate the remaining sanctions in a prudent manner as the council recognizes that the peace-building and development gains in Liberia could be reversed in light of the Ebola outbreak.
The Security Council ""decides further to maintain all of the above measures under continuous review with a view to modifying or lifting all or part of the measures of the sanctions regime dependent upon Liberia's progress towards meeting the conditions set out in resolution 1521 (2003) for terminating those measures and in light of the threat to peace and security in Liberia posed by the Ebola virus,"" according to the resolution.
The sanctions imposed a decade ago, was due to expire on December 12, 2014.
The arms embargo and other sanctions were imposed by the Security Council more than a decade ago as a response to the continued civil war in Liberia, where warring parties were involved in illegal arms traffic and diamond trade.
According to resolution 1521 which was adopted in 2003, the criteria for termination of these sanctions include a ceasefire in the country, completing disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and restructuring of the security sector, implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and making progress towards stability.
The draft resolution was put in blue on 3 December, following one meeting at the expert level. A day earlier, Council members held consultations on Liberia sanctions where the final report of the Panel of Experts (PoE) transmitted to the Council on 19 November (S/2014/831) was discussed and the following day the Council held a meeting with troop-contributing-countries (TCCs) for the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).
Negotiations on the draft resolution, which essentially constituted a technical roll-over as recommended in the Secretary-General's letter of 29 September (S/2014/707), were uncontroversial. The draft resolution renews for a period of nine months the arms embargo on Liberia, which was first imposed with resolution 1521 in 2003 and was modified to become a partial arms embargo on non-state actors with resolution 1903 in 2009.
It also renewed for nine months the targeted travel ban initially imposed with resolution 1521. The draft resolution further reaffirmed the asset freeze on former president Charles Taylor, his family and associates imposed by resolution 1532 in 2004, which is not time-limited. The draft resolution also renewed the mandate of the PoE for a period of ten months, with an update to the Committee due no later than 23 April and a final report due by 1 August.
The draft resolution identified two specific areas which remained a problem in Liberia: the proper management of arms and ammunition by the Liberian government, including enacting a necessary legislative framework, and effective monitoring and management of the border regions between Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire. These recurring issues had been previously highlighted in the Secretary-General's assessment of the Liberia sanctions regime conveyed to the Council on 29 September and in the final report of the PoE (as well as previous PoE reports). The draft resolution requests the Secretary-General to provide an update to the Council by 1 August on progress made by the government of Liberia with regard to arms and ammunition management and border control.
 

And prior to the Council's announcement, the meeting concluded earlier provided an opportunity for UNMIL TCCs that provided input prior to an adoption scheduled for 18 December renewing the peacekeeping operation's mandate. Due to the uncertainty caused by the Ebola outbreak, the Council last renewed UNMIL's mandate on 15 September with resolution 2176 for an interim period up to 31 December. It requested an update from the Secretary-General by 15 November and also expressed its intention to further extend UNMIL's mandate to 30 September 2015. On 12 November, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Herve Ladsous and Ambassador Per Thresson (Sweden), representative of the chair of the Liberia configuration of the Peacebuilding Commission briefed the Council (S/PV.7310). Ladsous recommended deferring consideration of a drawdown of troops and police from UNMIL until the Ebola crisis has ended. Tomorrow, TCC representatives are likely to be interested in how UNMIL's mandate may be modified due to the Ebola outbreak and what implications this may have for their personnel.",UN Security Council Renews Sanctions On Liberia,All Africa AFNWS English

Dec 09, 2014 (United Nations/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The following is a near-verbatim transcript of today's noon briefing by Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General.
Good afternoon and welcome to all of those watching on webcast.
**Secretary-General Travels
The Secretary-General arrived yesterday evening in Chicago, and this morning met with officials from the United States, including the Federal Aviation Association, as well as the Secretary of Transportation. He also met with the Mayor of Montreal. He then attended the opening of the Extraordinary Session of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council. As some of you may know, this year marks the seventieth anniversary of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, which established ICAO and was signed in Chicago, 70 years ago. In his remarks at the opening, the Secretary-General said that ICAO helps the UN address some of its most pressing issues on the global agenda, including in the areas of health, security and the environment.
The Secretary-General's last event in the Windy City was an event with Mayor Rahm Emanuel at the Rookery Building to showcase the efforts to promote energy efficiency in Chicago's buildings. Shortly, he will be taking off for Lima, Peru, where, as you know, he will attend the UN Climate Change Conference, which is already under way.
**Ebola
The fight against Ebola got a boost today with the arrival of 20,000 sets of Personal Protective Equipment from the Japan Disaster Relief Team. This is the first batch of 700,000 [sets] of such equipment committed by the Government of Japan to the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER). The equipment should help provide critical protection to healthcare workers in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Mali. At the official handover ceremony this morning in Accra, the head of the UN Mission, Anthony Banbury, thanked the Government of Japan and stressed the need for continued contributions from partners around the world to keep up the fight.
Meanwhile, the peacekeeper from the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), who tested positive for the Ebola virus disease on 3 December, was evacuated from the US-run Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia to the Netherlands on Saturday. Karin Landgren, the head of that Mission, said that she was encouraged that the medical evacuation process was organized quickly and efficiently, and that the patient, who was in stable condition, will receive the best possible treatment in a Dutch medical facility.
**UNICEF
And the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) has declared 2014 as a devastating year for children. In a press release issued today, the agency said that globally, an estimated 230 million children are currently living in countries and areas affected by armed conflict, including some 15 million of them in the Central African Republic, Iraq, South Sudan, Palestine, Syria and Ukraine. There have also been significant new threats to children's health and well-being, most notably in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where, as you know, the Ebola outbreak has orphaned thousands of children and kept an estimated 5 million children from attending schools. UNICEF says that, despite the tremendous challenges, the agency and its partners continue to provide life-saving assistance and other critical services, such as education and emotional support for children growing up in some of the most dangerous places on earth. And more information is available on the UNICEF website.
**Philippines
 

And from the Philippines, our humanitarian colleagues say that Typhoon Hagupit, which made landfall in Eastern Samar on 6 December, remains unpredictable as it moves towards Batangas Province, just south of Manila. So far, an estimated 1 million people have been relocated to 687 evacuation centres across the affected region and Metro Manila, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council of the Philippines. Humanitarian partners continue to liaise closely with the national authorities. Over the weekend, the World Food Programme (WFP) started providing transportation and food supplies in the impacted areas.
**Humanitarian Appeal
And speaking of humanitarian activities, in Geneva today, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, Valerie Amos, joined by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio Guterres, launched the 2015 global humanitarian appeal, asking for $16.4 billion to help at least 57.5 million people across the world. Ms. Amos said that the majority of the people who need assistance are in countries affected by conflicts. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs added that the crises in Central African Republic, Iraq, South Sudan and Syria, which account for more than 70 per cent of the funding requirements, will remain top humanitarian priorities next year. And we have Valerie Amos's remarks available online and in my office, most likely.
**Libya
The UN Support Mission for Libya (UNSMIL) says that it has held intense consultations with all major stakeholders to create a conducive environment for the mission's proposed dialogue. UNSMIL reiterates that dialogue remains the most viable and effective means of addressing the political crisis in Libya. The Mission has also stressed to all stakeholders that there will be no conditions attached to the dialogue, and that the primary objective will be to reach agreement on the management of the remainder of the transitional period, until a new permanent constitution is adopted.
**Syria
And regarding Syria, the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, as you know, is in Turkey, where he met with officials in Istanbul yesterday as part of his regional consultations. While in Turkey, he met with a delegation of the Syria National Coalition, headed by Hadi al-Bahra, the president of the coalition. During the meeting, Mr. de Mistura exchanged views on the proposed freeze in Aleppo and how to make it operational on the ground. He also met separately with Feridun SinirlioAYlu, the Under Secretary at the Turkish Foreign Ministry. And Mr. de Mistura is travelling today to Gaziantep, in southern Turkey, to discuss his plan with key rebel groups from Aleppo.
**Democratic Republic of the Congo
And turning to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Martin Kobler, head of the UN [Organization Stabilization] Mission in the [Democratic Republic of the Congo] (MONUSCO), said yesterday that he was deeply shocked at the massacres that took place over the weekend in Ahili and Manzanzaba, in the North Kivu Province. He condemned the attacks, which he said are intended to maintain a climate of terror in the region. Mr. Kobler pointed to the urgent need to increase the joint actions by the Congolese Armed Forces and the UN Mission, and he urged parties on the ground to cooperate to allow for those bodies to step up their patrols.
**Human Rights
Tomorrow, UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson will lead a public reading of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem, right here in New York City. The reading is part of a number of activities and actions taking place around the world to mark the commemoration of this year's Human Rights Day, which is on 10 December. This year, 10 December will also mark the launch by the General Assembly of the Decade of People of African Descent. The Decade will provide an opportunity to combat the continued inequality and disadvantage experienced by Africans and the African diaspora and to raise awareness of the legacy of slavery and colonialism.
And also on human rights, the Human Rights Council today elected a new President and Vice-Presidents for 2015. Ambassador Joachim Ruecker, Permanent Representative of Germany to the UN Office in Geneva, is the President-elect. And Ambassadors from Albania, Paraguay, Kazakhstan and Botswana have been elected to be Vice-Presidents for the one-year term, which starts on 1 January 2015.
**Press Conferences
After we are done here, the Deputy Spokesperson for the President of the General Assembly, Fanny Langella, will be here to brief you on the President of the General Assembly's participation in the Lima conference. And tomorrow, you will hear after my briefing from the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General
 

on Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, and International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda. They will brief on the anniversary of the Genocide Convention. And then, at 1:30 p.m., there will be another press conference related to the ICC, by the Coalition for the ICC on the 13th Session of the Assembly of State Parties to the Rome Statute.
Why don't we stop here?
**Questions and Answers
Question: Stephane, Israel attacked on Damascus and other areas in Syria recently; do you have any position on that? Also, about the report of UNDOF [United Nations Disengagement Observer Force], which shows clearly that there is collaboration between Israeli forces or between Israel and the rebel groups, including Jabhat al-Nusra, which is categorized as a terrorist organization, in the Golan.
Spokesman: Sure. I'll unpack your packed question. On the activities in the Golan, there is no specific comment, because the report itself is a comment by the Secretary-General. It's the Secretary-General's report. He has his observations. I think if you read the observations, you can underscore his grave concern at this situation, his call on parties who have an influence on the armed groups to bear that influence on them so that they cease their activities. He also condemns the violations of the ceasefire by the parties. And also stresses that the -- underscores the cooperation he has seen by both parties to the Disengagement Agreement in support of the UN activities, so the report in itself is the Secretary-General's comments on the situation. So, I'm not going to add anything to that.
On what happened at the airport in Damascus, we obviously are not in a position to determine who is responsible for those... for what happened. What I can tell you is that our colleagues in the UN Disengagement [Observer] Force in the Golan did observe some activities. Yesterday at 16:27 local time, UNDOF observed six aircraft flying at high altitude on the Alpha side. Two of them subsequently flew north-east over the area of separation, entering the area of limitation on the Bravo side. Any crossing of the area of separation is a breach of the ceasefire line.
Correspondent: In the report, it says clearly the Syrian aircraft which was shot down a few months ago was shot on the Bravo side. It was not... even off the Bravo side. And that there was no evidence that it has flew over the separation zone. However, it doesn't say that Israelis, by shooting down an aircraft in the Syrian side, violated the ceasefire or the separation agreement.
Spokesman: I think any... you know, again, the report is the Secretary-General's report. His observations are the comments, in a sense of what's happened in the period of observation. And I think as I just said, any crossing of the area of separation is a breach of the ceasefire line. Matthew and then Sherwyn?
Correspondent: Sure. I wanted to ask about... excuse me. The report... that report that you're talking about says that, you know, unfortunately, some assets were left behind or captured. And there's now photographs published by Al-Nusra of their use of a UN-painted vehicle for a suicide bomb in Deraa. So, I wanted to know, seems this kind of is directly like... this is UN material being used for...
Spokesman: Any misuse of UN material is clearly unacceptable, whether tragically for criminal activity, terrorist activity or any other misuse. We would demand that that equipment be returned to us.
Question: Because of the danger of people believing that a UN vehicle would be a safe place to be and then getting killed by it, what efforts have been made by either UNDOF, UN peacekeeping or the UN system to get those vehicles back? How many are gone?
Spokesman: This is something that continues to be of concern to us and something we continue to work on.
Question: Are there still missing vehicles?
Spokesman: That's all I have. Sherwyn?
Question: Steph, is it fair for us not to say that MONUSCO is failing in its protection of civilians mandate? We've seen a number of massacres, Beni, the latest this weekend... 36 people hacked to death. What's happening in terms of intelligence gathering? Why are not they not being able to see these attacks coming?
Spokesman: I don't think it's a failure. Obviously, the situation in the east of the country remains very volatile. MONUSCO is working with the local... with the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They are putting great effort into the situation. Obviously, as we all know, the area in question is vast. The resources of the UN peacekeeping missions are what they are.
Correspondent: Largest in the world.
 

Spokesman: But, we're also dealing with an area... an extremely huge area. The UN, along with the Armed Forces of the [Democratic Republic of the Congo], tries to be wherever they can. But, we're continuing to see acts of violence which are reprehensible and which are condemned. Evelyn?
Question: Yes, on the attack in Kivu, media reports point the finger to the Allied Democratic Forces Group, originally from Uganda. Do you have... can you confirm that?
Spokesman: No, I don't have anything else on that. Bu,t as you know, there is a deadline for the disarmament of these rebel groups in January. Mr. Kobler, I think, has spoken quite forcefully about what will happen if that deadline is not met. Yes, Richard?
Question: There is a large number of NGOs from the Middle East and Europe that have made calls in the last couple of days for Governments to attend tomorrow's Syrian refugee conference in Geneva to make some pledges. Is the Secretary-General going to support these calls? Is he encouraging Governments to attend?
Spokesman: Yes, definitely. We would like to see large representation and we would like to see large commitments made to the plight of these refugees. I think, as we have been saying quite often from here, the appeals are chronically under-funded. The needs are huge. But, they also remain chronically under-funded. Yes, ma'am?
Question: Does the Secretary-General or the... someone at the UN have anything to say about the House bill that was just passed by a huge majority, which is calling for an increase in military presence in all NATO countries? And if this is ratified by the Senate, this would lead to, obviously -- it would be kind of provocation.
Spokesman: No. We do not... we try and tend not to comment on legislation which is making its way through a legislative system. Mr. Lee?
Question: Sure. Couple questions about Sudan. One is the human rights leader, Amin Mekki Medani, has been arrested by the Government in Khartoum. I wanted to know that, and also a newspaper called Political Scope has been seized. And I wanted to know, I know that you had said that the office in Khartoum wasn't really a human rights office. Is there any comment either from UNAMID [African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur] or the UN system on what's seen as a crackdown on civil society?
Spokesman: I'll look into the reports.
Question: What about the letter? I wanted to nail down that this letter sent by Darfuri civil society groups about the rapes in Thabit and asking for DPKO [Department of Peacekeeping Operations] basically to answer, was that actually received? Is there going to be a written response by the Secretariat?
Spokesman: I haven't seen the letter. We can check if it's making its way through the internal postal system. Yes, ma'am?
Question: Right. Again, on Darfur, important is: were you aware of this AFP [Agence France-Presse] report that... ? Of course, when I need, it it's not there. Yes. That said they had an internal report from UNAMID last week, and it said the Sudanese military had tried to intimidate villagers as the peacekeepers interviewed them.
Spokesman: Obviously, our effort remains on trying to reach that town in order to try to clarify what has happened. I'll see if I can get anything more from the mission. But, that's where we stand at this point. Mr. Carpenter?
Question: Stephane, what [were] the results of the fundraising campaign for the Syrian refugees?
Spokesman: I just got off the phone with a colleague from WFP. I think they're tabulating the results. As soon as we have something to announce, we will. But they're counting, which is always a good sign. [He later added that WFP had said that the campaign was successful and that it would resume food vouchers for Syrian refugees for the month of December.] Anne?
Question: As noted in the week ahead at the UN, there will be a commemorative event on the eighty-first anniversary of the Holodamor of 1932 and 1933 in Ukraine.
Spokesman: Of what?
Question: Holodomor, tomorrow, 9 December in the Dag Hammarskjold Auditorium. Do you have more details on this annual event and the names of any particular speakers?
Spokesman: If you go into my office, you can ask Devi [Palanivelu]. She can probably tell you who is sponsoring that event. Mr. Lee?
 

Question: Sure. It's been announced in India that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will be visiting India on 10 and 11 January and go to Gujarat. What do you say to those reports? Spokesman: What do I say? I say what I say every time there is the report of the Secretary-General's travels: Unless we announce it, it ain't official. Question: Do you tell these interrogators to do the same? Are you miffed? Spokesman: Am I miffed when things leak? I don't know; I'll let you answer that.

4 December 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"4 December 2014 PNA (Philippines News Agency) PHILNA English (c) 2014 Philippines News Agency MANILA, Dec. 4 -- After completing their 21-day quarantine period in Caballo Island, officers and enlisted personnel of the 18th Philippine Contingent to Liberia (PCL) were given their well-deserved Heroes' Welcome Thursday afternoon.
The 110 members of the 18th PCL were formally welcomed by Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief-of-staff Gen. Gregorio Catapang.
Catapang also led the awarding of the United Nation Service Medals to the peacekeepers.
Defense Secretary Honorable Voltaire T. Gazmin graced the occasion.
'These peacekeepers showed once again the heroism, bravery, and commitment of our soldiers. I am happy for them that they can now formally join their families after their long tour in Liberia and the quarantine period they had in Caballo Island,' Catapang said.
After their Heroes' Welcome, Catapang gave the order allowing the peacekeepers to spend the coming Christmas holidays with their loved ones.
They will be reporting back to the AFP Peacekeeping Operations Center after celebrating Christmas and New Year.
The country started providing a peacekeeping contingent to Liberia in accordance with the UN Resolution 1509 in September 2003 that established the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).
It is tasked to assist in the maintenance of law and order in the country following a ceasefire that ended the Second Liberian Civil War.
The Filipino peacekeepers unit was tasked to provide force security to the headquarters and UNMIL leadership and in providing administrative services to the force headquarters.
One of the senior officers of the 18th PCL is Lt. Col. Samuel Villacrusis, the unit's deputy commander.
According to him, the primary challenge of the Filipino peacekeepers in Liberia is to secure UN VIPs amid the volatile security situation in that country.
'Our peacekeepers enjoy the trust of the UN leadership, which is why they chose us to be part of force security,' Villacrusis said.
During that time, the peacekeepers had enough freedom to visit popular places near their headquarters in Bushrod Island in Monrovia, particularly the Riverview and Caesar Beach, Royal Hotel, and Firestone, a rubber plantation in Liberia.
The situation, however, changed when the Ebola Virus Disease first broke out in February and again in May.
Since then, the movements of the peacekeepers were restricted to mission-essential areas, like their office and official itineraries of VIPs.
As medical non-commissioned officer of the 18th PCL, Technical Sgt. Vicente Alcoy was among those in charge of ensuring that the peacekeepers abide by the protocol laid out by UNMIL to prevent acquiring the dreaded disease.
'After our contingent commander ordered us to stay away from populated areas, my everyday duties included ensuring that our peacekeepers follow preventive measures like wearing surgical gloves, goggles, and masks,' Alcoy said.
 

The lives of peacekeepers inside their barracks did not change much, however, as they continued to be in touch with their loved ones in the country.
Alcoy used his free time talking to his family in Cavite via cellphone, particularly in checking the condition of his wife, Rachel, who had undergone a kidney operation before his deployment to Liberia.
'I only get to call her on the phone but because of that, I learned that her condition got better. The additional compensation from the UN also helped in sustaining her medication,' Alcoy said.
Despite the threat of Ebola, the Filipino peacekeepers remained relatively safe from infection.
This is because the nature of their mission did not entail direct contact with the locals, particularly patients infected with Ebola.
'Even after the first outbreak of Ebola in February this year, we remained focused on our mission of providing security to the force headquarters and commanders and in providing administrative duties,' Villacrusis stressed.
The peacekeepers remained in Liberia until the end of their extended tour of duty, which was supposedly for nine months at the maximum.
The peacekeepers were deployed for 11 months in Liberia to facilitate also the permanent pull-out of the contingent.
'We received news from the Department of National Defense that we will have to pull out. Eventually, we were warned of our imminent repatriation in November, so we had to pack-up not only our personal belongings but also the equipment and facilities of the entire contingent,' Villacrusis said.
The peacekeepers informed their families of their repatriation and the 21-day quarantine that will further delay their meeting.
They both said that the peacekeepers and their families understood the necessity of the quarantine.
Members of the 18th PCL along with some staff officers and military observers of UNMIL were immediately brought to Caballo Island shortly after their arrival in Nov. 12.
The quarantine was a measure implemented to ensure that the country will remain Ebola-free.
Catapang ensured the peacekeepers of a fun, productive, and relaxing stay in Caballo Island.
Joint Task Group-Liberia, a special unit activated to supervise the quarantine, prepared games and activities for the peacekeepers.
Air-conditioned, wifi-ready, and cable TV-equipped billeting areas were also prepared.
Prior to their arrival at Caballo Island, some peacekeepers were worried of the situation they will be in during the quarantine.
However, their fears were allayed upon arrival there.
'Our misconceptions suddenly shifted to amazement. I felt that the efforts of the Task Group Liberia (TGL) and the Philippine Air Force (PAF) should be commended,' Technical Sgt. Orlando B. Harion, a force engineer clerk of UNMIL, said.
Catapang also wanted to ensure that the peacekeepers could freely communicate with their families, which was important in keeping their morale high while in the island.
'They gave us everything we needed. We have internet connection and strong phone signal so we could talk to our families as much as we want. We felt at home because we could also see our family over the internet,' Alcoy said.
Apart from their daily body temperature monitoring, the peacekeepers were also subjected to physical and mental conditioning through sports and board games.
'Daily activities were set so that the peacekeepers will be occupied. The day usually starts with the cleaning of our surroundings, physical exercises followed by some sports activities where we compete with the other teams from other Igloos,' Harion added.
According to Villacrusis, Caballo Island was more than they expected.
 

'We were generally happy and in high-morale. As officer-in-charge and on behalf of the peacekeepers in Caballo Island, I want to extend our gratitude to our top leadership, especially to General Catapang, for making our quarantine a truly memorable experience,' Villacrusis concluded.

Dec 01, 2014 (Vanguard/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Unveiling Nigeria's Top 100 Companies: Militant Islamism has expanded in northern Nigeria over decades. Its trajectory can be traced because of the central role played by Wahhabi religious institutions in Saudi Arabia in the propagation of Salafist Islam. This process has included the training of clerics, the funding of mosques and schools, and the cultivation of dynamic leaders. The gifted scholar and preacher, Ja'far Mahmoud Adam, became the prime propagator in this network in the mid-2000s. He was killed on April 13, 2007 after virulently denouncing the more extreme views of his protege, Mohammed Yusuf. When Yusuf and hundreds of his followers were killed by Nigerian police forces in July 2009, the movement went underground. It re-emerged in 2010, popularly referred to as Boko Haram, ready to wage jihadist war against the Nigerian state, Western education, and national and international institutions.
It has since adopted every tactic available to contemporary insurgent and terrorist organizations. There are no limits to its brutality as it has targeted school children and very ordinary folk. Its vociferous leader, Abubakar Shekau, taunts the Nigerian government for its inability to crush his movement.New and sustained reflections are needed about a movement that now poses a dire threat to the Nigerian nation, its federal democracy, and neighboring countries. It has become part and parcel of militant global Islamism. To this end, AfricaPlus makes available the second and final part of a November 3 interview of Richard Joseph, a professor of international history and politics at Northwestern University, the United States, US, by Jerome McDonnell of WBEZ, Chicago, followed by responses from Akin Osuntokun and Prof. Bolaji Akinyemi.
What do you make of the situation in Nigeria?
Nigeria is in a very critical situation and Americans and others need to pay closer attention. The Obama Administration is very focused on Iraq and Syria, and on combating the Islamic state. But there is now an avowed Islamic state in Africa.
And this is the Boko Haram ""state"" in northern Nigeria?
Correct. They have declared a caliphate, with Gwoza as its capital. They control an estimated 8,000 to 9,000 square miles of territory. That would be equivalent to the American state of New Jersey, or Massachusetts. They've not only kept the Nigerian military at bay but many Nigerian soldiers are terrified of their fighters. It seems increasingly clear that the Nigerian military is not able to defeat Boko Haram on its own. Nigeria is in pre-electoral mode with national elections coming up in February, so this is a very critical period for the nation.
It seems that Goodluck Jonathan is not the candidate you would want to back if you sought a change in the situation in northern Nigeria. He's not from the region. The country used to take turns with leadership, with people from the North and South. Now it seems like that tradition is busted.
That is right. America has been fortunate with wartime presidents. We had Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the Second World War. When he died, his vice-president, Harry S. Truman, took over. Truman turned out to be a darned good president, and also superb in international affairs. Goodluck Jonathan, like Truman, is an accidental president, who follows an ineffective president, Umaru Yar'Adua. Yar'Adua was not only politically but physically weak. The person responsible for their elevation to high office was Olusegun Obasanjo. Obasanjo was twice Nigeria's head of state, as a military ruler in the late 1970s and as an elected president from 1999 to 2007. He spent most of his second term trying to get rid of the two-term constitutional limit. When he had to leave, he ushered in Yar'Adua from the far North as president and, for the vice presidency, Goodluck Jonathan, from the South-south, that is, the Delta oil-producing region. Yar'Adua was critically ill for several months in 2009-2010 but wouldn't hand over power to Jonathan. He was finally forced to do so on February 9, 2010 and died shortly thereafter, on May 5. Jonathan completed his term and then ran in 2011 and won. Following that election, violent and highly destructive rioting took place in northern Nigeria.
 

The North has been in decline and its residents are generally disenchanted. It must be understood that the Boko Haram insurgency is taking place in a region of about 80 million people in a country about twice that size, about 170 million. Goodluck Jonathan is looked upon by many in the North as having taken over the North's term in office. Because of Yar'Adua's weakness and his uncompleted first term, they feel their ""turn"" in the presidency was usurped. Jonathan stated that he would only run for one term. To no one's surprise, he has recently announced his decision to run again in 2015. He is competing for the presidency at a time when oil prices have dropped sharply. Nigeria doesn't have much financial reserves. The Excess Crude Oil Account is largely depleted. Reserves from petroleum revenues have been drawn to maintain political support. Nigeria is therefore entering a period of great uncertainty.
The United States seems to have taken a serious interest in Boko Haram and put them in its security framework. I was surprised when I heard the Head of Central Intelligencetalking about Boko Haram and drone strikes. It's a situation that they appear to take very seriously.
Yes, they take it seriously, but there are a number of problems. The first is that it's difficult dealing with the Nigerian government and also the Nigerian military. There is also the disturbing fact of publicized atrocities, human rights abuses, conducted by Nigerian security forces. This makes it difficult, given American law, to cooperate with them.
The other problem is that Nigeria is a very nationalist country. Nigerians consider their nation to be a major one. It is not like Sierra Leone, where the British intervened in May 2000 and drove back the militias. Or Mali, where the French did the same to the jihadists in January 2013. So the question is: Will Nigeria be able to work with external help, and will it accept that help? It does not appear able to defeat Boko Haram on its own, in the same way that Iraqi forces cannot defeat the Islamic State. So how is Nigeria going to get the necessary external assistance? What the US and coalition forces are doing in Iraq and Syria is what is needed in Nigeria. Nigeria needs a higher level of intervention, and I don't see how that will happen.
Is there a non-military way to do it? Everybody looked at the military solution in Iraq and said ""this isn't really going to work, but we're going to do it anyway"". It would seem that there would be a political avenue to take in Nigeria with the coming presidential election. It presents an opportunity to create more political space for people in the North to feel included in what's going on..
Let me touch on the military aspect before moving on to the political. As President Barack Obama said in his speech at the U.N. on September 24, there has to be a military response to violent jihadists. The same is true with regard to Boko Haram in Nigeria. A month ago, there were supposedly talks taking place in the Chadian capital, N'Djamena. We were told that the release of the Chibok girls and a ceasefire were imminent. All that evaporated and the warfare has intensified.
Getting to the political side, you do have a point. There is an opening for Nigeria. Discussing this opportunity puts me in an odd position. I have no intention of seeking to influence Nigerian electoral politics. A few major parties enjoying control of state governments have come together and formed an opposition coalition, the All Progressives Congress (APC). Its likely candidate for the presidency, unless for some reason he decides to step aside, is Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari has run for the presidency a number of times and also served as a military head of state, 1984-85. Assuming he is the APC presidential candidate, and has a respected southerner as his running mate, the APC could mount a major challenge to Jonathan and the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP).
Nigeria has a highly presidential system, but this is combined with a sub-regional or zonal approach to national politics. When Goodluck Jonathan moved from acting to official president on May 6, 2010, his presence helped tamp down the long-running armed insurgency in the Niger-Delta. For the combatants, and regional politicians, their man was now in control in Abuja, with access to abundant government resources. It would be understandable if some Nigerians, especially northerners, believed that the only way to mobilize the needed forces to defeat Boko Haram would be to bring a northerner to power.
There are two further relevant points. One of the greatest failures in Nigeria has been the failure of northern political (including military) leaders to enact a modernizing project for their region. They did not develop the North when they had privileged access to enormous financial resources. The second point concerns the military establishment. What are senior Nigerian officers thinking? Earlier, matters would not have reached this point. Nigerians would have already heard martial music on the radio and television, followed by announcements that the military had resumed control. During his term as an elected president, Obasanjo, as a military man and former coup-leader, succeeded in weakening the military's threat to civilian government. But how long is the military going to allow this situation to persist?
Do you have any advice for the United States and what it should do? It rushed into Liberia at the pleading of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to combat Ebola. You would need to drag the United States into serious military involvement in West Africa. But could it play any kind of role here that would be beneficial?
 

If I had to imagine an American role, it would look as follows. We are dealing with African geopolitics and global geopolitics. The African geo-political situation concerns a band of insecurity, instability and insurgency from the Northeast to the North-west of the continent. What is taking place in northern Nigeria connects with what occurred in Mali and southern Algeria. The Boko Haram insurgency also involves northern Cameroon, Niger, and Chad. This is the regional African geo-political dimension. Second is global geo-politics in terms of global Islamism. Goodluck Jonathan went to Paris in May 2014 to attend a meeting convened by the president of France, Francois Hollande, of regional African presidents. It seemed a little odd because, why couldn't Jonathan just invite those leaders to Abuja for such a meeting? But it gives a sense of what we're dealing with in terms of regional leadership. What the U.S. must do is work more effectively with the French, the British, and other European partners. They need to put together a coalition, because coalitions have worked well in support of peace efforts and democratic transitions in Africa. We've seen this in Mali, Niger, the Ivory Coast, and even Somalia. There's a need to put together one of these coalitions, bring together African leaders, executives of the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and others and sit down with Goodluck Jonathan and his advisers. He has to be told, if he doesn't acknowledge it, that Nigeria is not winning the struggle. It had thirty-six states; it now has a thirty-seventh, a rogue state. Is Nigeria going to accept this loss of sovereignty? If not, a Western and African coalition must work with Nigerians to reverse this alarming situation.",The Dangerous Mix of Terrorism and Political Power Struggle in Nigeria - U.S. Prof. Richard Joseph [opinion],All Africa AFNWS English 
26 November 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"26 November 2014 11:57 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2014 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved
Nov 26, 2014 (Daily Trust/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- One persistent and inescapable truism in the conduct of international affairs is that there can be no permanent friends or eternal enemies in the intricate relationships between nations as they seek to project or realize their national interests. In that sense, previously avowed mortal enemies could easily become staunch allies a few years down the line, depending of course, on the contingent realities of the times, and their appreciation of how their national interests could be diminished or enhanced by their chosen courses of action.
Call it realism for a better word; in the quick sand of international politics, the robust understanding of the strategic national objectives or interests of nations makes their concurrent or even impending decisions in their relationships with others more predictable. Put in reverse order, the foreign policy thrusts and aspirations of nations are almost without exception predicated on the dictates of its specific national interests.
For more than a century the America's foreign policy was deeply rooted on the fundamentals of its 'core national interests' which included democracy, liberty, freedom, justice and free enterprise. It never mattered that in the pursuit those very objectives, America's foreign policy behaviour directly, or indirectly, led to the truncation of legitimate, albeit contentious choices of governments by the people of Congo (September 1960), and Chile (September 1973).
For as long as the successive US governments at the time were able to convince the gullible American public that such foreign interventions - which frequently led to the fall of foreign governments and the enthronement of dictators like Mobuto in Congo/Zaire and Pinochet in Chile - were necessary to check the scourge of communism, they fitted snugly with their strategic national interests. It did not matter that such wilful interventions in pursuit of the American national interests invariable came to grief in so many far-flung locations as it did in disastrous circumstances in Vietnam.
Before Nigeria's oil boom rapidly degenerated into the predictable doom many foretold, Africa was the centre-point of our foreign policy. Even the later resolve to define the same policy in three concentric cycles did little to detract from the resolve to allow the interests of Africa to determine the content and structure of Nigeria's foreign policy objectives. As Nigeria's first Foreign Minister Hon. Aja Nwa-chukwu put it at the time: 'Charity begins at home and therefore any Nigerian foreign policy that does not take into consideration the peculiar position of Africa is unrealistic'. (Emphasis mine).
And so with charity in our minds, and little in terms of a solid Nigerian-centric ideological basis or framework for our foreign policy, Nigeria got involved deeply in the decolonization struggles in Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, and anti-apartheid struggles in South Africa. We rejoiced at the honorary appellation a 'frontline nation', even though we were geographically far removed from the theatre of the struggles.
Nigeria topped that by taking some drastic economic measures in support of its Africa-focussed foreign policy that ultimately hurt its own local economy. We nationalized companies like British Petroleum (BP) and Barclay's Bank because their government procrastinated over the need for liberation of the colonized nations in Southern Africa.
We topped that by spending billions of badly needed dollars at home trying to export the democracy we didn't have at the time to Liberia and Sierra-Leone. The ratio of our human and material contributions to ending the civil wars in both countries against our status as a developing nation was unprecedented in history. And yet, for our role, we merely earned President Clinton's recognition as the 'morale superpower' of the world and unlimited insults from our beneficiaries. Today, only foreign policy neophytes could fail to see that South Africa has always regarded Nigeria as a major threat or rival for supremacy on the African continent. And with there being no permanent friends or interest in international relations, we can hold few grudges for their perceived ingratitude.
 

Our charitable foreign policy did not earn us the universal recognition we craved and will not guarantee us the illusive permanent seat on the United Nation's Security Council when that anachronistic arm of the UN is grudgingly reformed to reflect the contingent realities of our times.
Still, to be fair, successive Nigerian governments, beginning from the 1980s up till 2007, appeared to have shifted the focus of our foreign policy a bit. We heard loose talk about economic diplomacy and reciprocity in the conduct of our foreign affairs for the first time. But even today, with the rampant insurgency in the North East and collective international efforts required to contain it, we appear not to have learnt enough lessons from the past. With this Jonathan administration, one is not even sure what the blueprint for the nation's foreign policy is.
Given the way the so-called cease-fire with Boko-Haram brokered by the President of Chad quickly unravelled, and the nauseating revelations in the media on the exact reasons for the farce, one cannot fail but wonder if Nigeria has learnt any lessons from the past at all.
Surely, only government officials who lacked the critical intellectual rigour required for the consummation of such delicate deals could have fallen so cheaply for the lies fed to our government by the complicit government in Ndjamena. Chadian rebels, unless we chose to forget, once violated our territorial integrity in the 1980s.
And Chad, like the other francophone nations in the sub-region is not better than a vassal of France which considers such nation's to belong to its exclusive sphere of influence. Our recent history will also show that France has always been wary of Nigeria's clout in Africa especially in the West African sub-region. It was the major reason why France, under Charles de Gaulle, along with Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Gabon, were among the handful of nations to recognize Biafra at the onset of the Nigerian civil war for easily predictable reasons.
The more Nigeria becomes an attraction to the French-speaking nations in the region, the more the influence of France becomes diminished as a direct consequence. It is for that reason that France has military pacts with most of its former colonies on the continent. It was also for the same reason why it backed Cameroun against Nigeria in the dispute over the Bakassi peninsular not too long ago.
And while we are on the same subject matter, with Cameroun also at the receiving end of Boko Haram attacks, it has become abundantly obvious that Chad, which has not suffered from any such recorded invasions despite its close proximity with the insurgents, is either considered an ally by the sect, or is in fact the launch pad for its activities. All insurgents groups in history required safe heavens. When Fidel Castro and Che Guevara launched their revolution in the 1950's, it was from the relative safety of the Sierra Maestra Mountains in south-eastern Cuba. Surely, our intelligence community do not believe the Boko Haram forces are like ghost who can appear and disappear easily into a void!
But there is yet another important factor why an inquest into the role of Chad and by extension France has become a matter of urgent priority. Whether by coincidence or not, most of the areas affected by the insurgency are located on the northern fringes of the Chad basin known to be rich in oil and Gas resources!
If France stays loyal to its strategic interests on the African continent; if Chad has always been an unreliable neighbour and now serves as a safe heaven and launching pad for Boko Haram; and, if the Chadian President is chummy with the likes of Ali Modu Sherriff, why should the sect be suing for peace anytime soon?
Besides, why must Nigeria bar-gain or negotiate with terrorists or any insurgency group from the position of weakness. When the late Yar'Adua coerced the militants in the Niger Delta to embrace his peace initiative, he had to demonstrated the folly of their armed struggle in the creeks by seizing the military initiative on the ground. The Nigerian military Task Force was unrelenting in their pursuit. Today, our soldiers are demoralized and flee like rabbits from the heat of battle. They dread to confront Boko Haram, and the commanders of the terrorist group know it.","Boko Haram - Time for Inquest Into Chad's Role [opinion]

New York, Nov 24, 2014 (United States Department of State/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- U.S. Mission to the United Nations, Office of Press and Public Diplomacy. Remarks by Ambassador Samantha Power, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, at the Defense One Summit, November 19, 2014
Moderator: Tell me a little more about that trip and there was that famous Reuters picture of you getting your temperature taken at the airport. You know, what was the trip like? And what were you seeing on the ground in terms of what -
Ambassador Power: Yeah, well, it's actually particularly thrilling to be able to describe at least one aspect of the trip to this audience because I think, partly because journalists are staying away from the region. I mean, ironically, more away from West Africa, where if you do everything right the risk is almost zero, than are staying away from Iraq and even Syria border areas and so forth.
I mean, but because they're staying away I thought sure that the story of what the U.S. military is doing has been all that well told. And I encourage any journalist to get over there quickly to see it. Because what makes it really unusual from our daily bread, in terms of foreign policy and, you know, trying to make a difference in the developing world, is that we have science and we have statistics and we have data and we can see linearly the difference that having the U.S. presence on the ground is making.
And I'll just give one example. I flew from Monrovia with General Valesky, who is commanding the effort there now, to a place called Bong County. Now, Bong County had been a very affected Ebola area in Liberia. And U.S. helicopter could take us in; had we had to drive, it would have taken six, eight hours from Monrovia, you know, crummy roads. And we get there and we meet three Navy microbiologists who had set up an Ebola lab two weeks before. Prior to their arrival, the turnaround time on Ebola tests was a week, almost, between five to seven days. It had to be driven, often on motorcycles, on these crappy roads to Monrovia, then they had to wait because there's only one lab in the whole country. And for that week, Ebola negative and Ebola positive people were living intermingled, waiting for their results, thereby creating a huge infection risk.
Because of these three Navy guys and their little microbiology lab - one of the guys had gotten into microbiology, decided to become one, because he had read The Hot Zone. So for him it was a dream, a little boy's dream, to be looking in a microscope and actually working on such an important issue - now, the testing times are three to five hours; and so, and 70% of the people getting tested are negative. So, they just go back to their homes and their village - they might have malaria; they might need other treatment; they might have a cold - and beds are freed up then for people who are infected.
So that's just an example where you could measure the turnaround time. So too the 2,200 American troops who are there so far, building these Ebola Treatment Units; initially we had said we'd do 17, 100-bed units. Now the U.S. military is turning on a dime and doing instead some 100 bed units, but also 10 beds here, 20 beds there, and really trying to adapt with the virus.
So, it's been a learning experience, I think, for everyone in the U.S. government on the foreign policy side. But to see how quickly our forces have learned, teaming up also with the CDC, and our medics as part of the U.S. Public Health Service who are treating now Liberian health workers. I mean, our people, getting trained to put on that white PPE, and be in the sweltering heat, wearing, treating people two, three hours at a time because it's such a difficult effort. I mean, it's really been - it's a sight to behold. And so I really hope the media can get out there, that can get conveyed. But I've never been prouder. I've seen U.S. military in action in Iraq, in Bosnia, in Kosovo. And just the multi-dimensional way in which we are learning on the fly how to do this.
Now, the results, the most important question, are decent in Liberia. You're already seeing infection rates level off and the rate of increase - the rate of increase decrease - so Liberia is in a better position, much better position, by virtue of this. Many more issues in Sierra Leone and Guinea. And the British military is
 

active in Sierra Leone and doing a great job, but there are more gaps in Sierra Leone between what the British are providing and the overall need, and so we're also looking at USAID and the military, how we can support the British effort and how we can get other countries to fill in whatever outstanding gaps exist.
Moderator: A personal question first and then back to the big picture. Were you personally concerned about any of it? And did you have to take your temperature twice a day when you got back?
Ambassador Power: I still do. In fact, I had to call it in this morning. I will call it in tonight - I'm almost to day 21. I was at an event a couple of days ago where someone came up to me and said, ""You're on day 18."" And I was like, ""Oh, you were clearly checking before you came to this event.""
[Laughter]
But, you know, once you really become immersed in it and you know how it is transmitted - that it's not airborne, you know, that people, you know, who are, even people who end up having Ebola, but who were asymptomatic, are not going to be passing it; there's such low levels of the virus in the bloodstream. We stayed out of the Ebola treatment units, so I had the CDC - I went over the itinerary with the CDC and made sure, you know, we didn't take any risks. And you go, and it's actually the sense of normalcy and people going about their business, is very, very striking.
My son - I have a five year old boy, Declan - who was saying, ""Mommy, don't go to the Bola place, don't go to the... "" and I said, ""Son, we gotta fight the stigma. It's not the Bola place. It's Liberia. It's amazing. Let me tell you about the history of this amazing relationship with the United States."" And now he's obsessed with the Liberian flag because it looks just like the U.S. flag. So we've opened up a whole new channel for discussion in our household.
But you know, people - Ebola is new to us. It's not new to some parts of Africa, but it's new to us. And so, I think knowing what it is and what it isn't has been a learning process. But I think we're in a better place also here domestically. People have a better sense of, you know, where the risks are and where they aren't.
Moderator: But on the big picture front, General Dempsey was here earlier saying a year ago we would not have thought that we'd have U.S. military forces in West Africa looking at Ebola, would not necessarily have thought about ISIL being the main source of the fight. Are we in too many places? Is the U.S. the world's policeman? And how do you approach that question given both your background, the work you've done, and the real humanitarian efforts that you've been a part of and really championed and talked about and made a career of really trying to bring to the American public's attention?
Ambassador Power: Well, it's a great question and we are asking an awful lot right now of our forces, and the Chairman does an amazing job deciding among competing priorities and figuring how to advise the president where to deploy our precious resources. But, so, I would say no, we can't be the world's policemen. There's just too much going on. I see it every day in the Security Council, whether it's Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Darfur is still raging.
Moderator: And you've visited a lot of those places.
Ambassador Power: I have. Congo - I mean, in Africa alone, you know, to be the world's policemen would drain you of the capacity to do anything else with your resources.
But that's not what we're here to do. But I think what we've seen, I think ISIL and Ebola are really good examples of this, are ways in which we can lead the world by making investments early and leveraging them to get other countries to step up. So, I mention the British in Sierra Leone. No question that had United States - that the fact that the United States had come forward and made such a large troop contribution made it easier for Prime Minister Cameron to work with his military; to show up; to know we'd be doing it in parallel with one another. So, too, we now have the Germans contributing. Refitted Lufthansa planes to medevac people who have Ebola. German officers are on the ground. Chinese medical workers have showed up ready to staff Ebola treatment units, even the ones that we or the British or others built. So, you see the investments being made by virtue of us taking this leadership role.
And ISIL's another good example. Again, there are more countries now joining us in the air strikes, joining us in equipping the Iraqi security forces, taking on the training and equipping of particular units as part of the ISF. And then the humanitarian piece of it, which also - where there has to be a much better division of labor, because too often the United States ends up carrying the lion's share of the humanitarian work as well, particularly in Iraq, where countries were often very reluctant because of the earlier situation - were reluctant sometimes to pull their fair share of the humanitarian burden.
I think now people understand ISIL is different because of the foreign terrorist presence within the movement and the risk that those people will come home and pose a threat to European or American or Asian citizens that makes it different. But also, just the horror show that ISIL puts in place every time that they, every place
 

that they encounter, whether its enslaving Yazidi women or expelling Christians or forcing people to convert or mass execution - I mean. So that, I think, has made it - that, combined with our president's, the steps the president took and leveraged - has made it easier to build this 60-nation coalition that we now have in action.
Moderator: There has been a lot of frustration from people who say that the Syrian opposition, or the boots on the ground in Syria, have not gotten all the resources they have requested. And there's a fine line between how do you vet, how do you get resources to people on the ground. And some concern that there won't be a moderate opposition left by the time that real resources get to them. How do you approach the idea of U.S. military intervention versus the whole toolkit? Because you said there has to be something between, you know, sending in the U.S. Marines or doing nothing at all. How do you approach that question?
Ambassador Power: Well, I approach it very much with the guidance of President Obama and his view on this is that there are major short-term challenges in Syria, no question. And the moderate opposition has lost ground in recent months, no question. That said, we have established channels with groups, with vetted groups, who got into this whole effort because they wanted to protect their families and stave off chemical attacks and barrel bomb attacks and so forth, who still espouse the vision for Syria that drove the revolution in the first place; and that these people are worthy of our support. And the DOD program will be one where those people will be filtered through, both to fight ISIL and to protect their families and their communities against the regime.
So we have to invest in that long game, as it were, that enterprise because, as the president has said, we can't have a choice between beheaders, you know, force-converters on the one hand, and, barrel-bomb users and chemical attackers on the other. That's not a choice that the majority of the Syrian people would choose to make. They would not choose either of those options. And so for as long as those are the two options in a particular area, this war is going to continue because people are not going to tolerate that kind of leadership, as it were.
So I think we have to invest. I would note that one of the real reasons in the last, you know, nine months that the moderate opposition has lost ground is that it was fighting on two fronts. And the damage that ISIL's ascent and its brutality did on, you know, mainly Sunni opposition groups, armed groups, and Sunni opposition civilians, really is unspeakable. Now, because of the strikes against ISIL in Iraq and also in Syria, our hope is - coupling that with the train and equip program, getting that off the ground as quickly as possible - that they will start to get some relief from the ISIL part, that sort of two front war, and then better be able to protect themselves against the regime. So that's the approach we're taking.
Moderator: But you're known as someone who's very direct and very action-oriented and I wondered if it's ever frustrating for you, the time lag between knowing that people need resources and the time it will actually take to get them there.
Ambassador Power: Yes, it is. It is, of course. I mean, particularly, in the Syria context because you have here a conflict that's now going on since 2011. You have more than seven million people displaced. And as a parent or not a parent, just to imagine what it's like to try to flee. Many, many families have fled multiple times. They think they find refuge in one place and then barrel bombs come back and they have to go somewhere else. The countries that are neighboring Syria are really bursting at the seams in terms of the number of refugees that they have absorbed; that's causing all kinds of social tension and dislocation.
So, just the sheer heartbreak metric is just so high and, you know, we have a strategy that we can inject some new life into a political process, again, if the moderate opposition can hold their ground and then get strengthened over time. But, of course, you want to help every family in the here and now. And so we do what we can on the humanitarian side as the largest donor by far to try to feed people who have been displaced and found refuge somewhere. And, obviously, try to work at the U.N. and in other venues to try to establish, also, some accountability for the atrocities that are being carried out.
Moderator: You have talked about the post-World War II architecture that was created, and we're still living in that. And I wonder if you think that the post-World War II architecture is sufficient in a world that is on fire in any number of corners? Is - does reform have to happen, or are there new institutions needed? Is the world up to doing the job that is required in so many places now, including Syria?
Ambassador Power: Well, I think the first answer to that question probably is that we should each look at our national response capabilities because, at least as far as the eye can see, nation-states are the foundation of the international order. Social protest movements and non-state actors, in terms of civil society, but also on the nefarious side, in terms of terrorists, they're obviously shaping events in different parts of the world in very important - in the case of terrorists, very disturbing ways. But by the same token, the response capabilities, the monopoly on force lies with the state.
So, Ebola's a really good example. We are building muscle memory. Every day, we, our military is involved in responding to an infectious disease outbreak. That's muscle memory that needs to be captured, exploited as
 

it were, you know, built upon. And we need to learn the lesson that, of course, this outbreak, in terms of the weakness of the health infrastructure in these three countries - the president had launched well before this outbreak this global health security initiative. Now, it's got new energy from other countries that maybe hadn't been as seized of the issue as we had been. So that's an example of - that's just on a public health and security side - but the kinds of ways we need to learn from the experiences we're having and then adapt our capabilities and then get better at pooling the capabilities to be able to respond to a crisis.
Another example I can give on the more traditional security side is peacekeeping, where I've made a real push under President Obama's leadership to both render peacekeeping missions more efficient, because there are more of them and they are more and more expensive, because there are so many around the world, and because there are real costs now to fortifying U.N. bases that used to be - before the Canal Hotel attack in Baghdad, which we were talking about before we walked out here - used to be, you know, that people could come up to U.N. bases, walk in and out, check their e-mail or whatever. We can't have that anymore. So that's adding a layer of expense. So we try to make them more efficient, but also try to get countries that in the 1990s were involved in peacekeeping, such as those in Europe, and who got out to get back in. Because right now you have a situation where developed countries by and large are paying for peacekeepers and developing countries are actually performing those missions.
We also need to enhance the capabilities - this is something where the US military and our partners in Europe and elsewhere are helping - we need to deepen the abilities of those countries that are willing to put their troops forward. So, to take a couple of examples: Rwanda and Ethiopia, the two largest African troop contributors. If there's a crisis in the Central African Republic, and Muslims are getting targeted by Christians, or Christians by Muslims, the Rwandans are usually the first to raise their hand because of their own history. And yet, they don't have the capacity to lift themselves into countries. So, that's something the U.S. military often does.
They don't have the capacity, often, to fully sustain themselves, to have the kind of logistic tail that they need in a pinch, and so if we want to support Rwanda to be a kind of regional peacekeeping force in the way that it has been, and to protect civilians and to bring a new energy in peacekeeping, we've got to not only lift them to, you know, this mission or that mission, but also work toward the day when they can lift themselves and be fully self-sustaining. So, the president has launched something called the African [Peacekeeping Rapid] Response Partnership with six African militaries that are the most likely to come forward and some of the most capable militaries on the continent. And now we're seeking to pool training, resources, and capabilities from our European partners so that over time we could really see six African militaries capable of doing what we know only we can do.
And remember, we're - peacekeeping's often a little bit of a sideline compared to the issues that are dealt with, you know, by our military. But more and more of these missions are finding themselves in places that have a nexus to our national security interest, like Somalia, like Mali, even like Central Africa Republic, where you can already see Boko Haram and al Shabaab kind of checking it out, and then in other countries to see whether there's fertile ground to be exploited. So we have an interest in peacekeeping becoming more effective, even beyond the atrocity prevention and civilian protection interests.
Moderator: Is there a greater role for the U.S. military to play in the UN peacekeeping?
Ambassador Power: Well, already, if you take the Central African Republic, which I've now mentioned a couple times, it's the U.S. that is helping build the bases that the peacekeepers are deploying to. We President Obama allocated up to a million dollars to train and equip those units going in. We have more than a hundred military and police officers who are now sprinkled out across missions. And I really encourage those kinds of deployments, which I think you get a minimal risk. But just using that kind of niche capability of being a planner - you know, our planners helping the African Union with the Somali mission, our planners helping with the Central Africa Republic mission - just a small deployment of a handful of guys and you can imagine the kind of command and control ethos and the professionalism that that can generate at a mission. So we're doing a lot, actually.
Moderator: You talked about lessons learned. I just want to talk about Libya for one second, which it seems like it is a lesson in both the pitfalls and the real opportunities of intervention. I just wonder what are the lessons learned and how do those inform what you think about Syria?
Ambassador Power: Well, Libya certainly is not - this morning when I got off the airplane from New York, there as hope of a ceasefire, and then just as I was coming in it looks like that ceasefire is not holding in the least. So Libya's is in a very, very, difficult state right now. You know, looking back to 2011, there was a moment where Qaddafi made very clear his intentions toward, not only people of Benghazi, but anybody who had taken up arms against him. President Obama, I think, made very much the right choice, which is to prevent what - I think again, if we take Qaddafi at his word and look at the practices that he had employed up to that point in repressing the rebellion - could have been, you know, a horrific massacre.
 

The intervention occurred. We had a lot of countries by our side and, again, U.S. leadership creating a broad coalition so we weren't bearing the burden alone. The challenge is that there is in Libya a set of tribal dynamics that were unleashed and very little tradition of people peacefully adjudicating their differences because of Qaddafi's former rule. So at some point when Qaddafi left, those elements were going to be unleashed, and unfortunately, we're not living in, not us, but the Libyan people are having to live in that environment.
Again, I think there is too much, ""Oh, this is what intervention has wrought."" I mean, you know, if you take a case where - you look at Syria today, right, where people rose up and the government decided to repress the rebellion in earnest, you know, that's not also a model society. In other words, things are extremely difficult there, excruciatingly difficult for civilians in Syria.
So, I think one has to be careful about overdrawing lessons or ascribing to one particular action a whole set of consequences that ensue, because when leaders repress their people and indeed set out to massacre them, it's not like the people go away, right? Once those sentiments have been unleashed and they're looking to claim agency for their children, it's very hard to put that back in the box. And so that's where the Tunisia model, which is not a model, sadly, that a lot of governments in the Middle East have taken, but has been a much more stable one because trying to maintain a social compact, however unwieldy it is, is a better route to getting the kind of stability and democracy they're seeking.
Moderator: The last question as we wrap up. You gave a really moving speech in 2013 about how skepticism about foreign intervention is really important, but that, you know, I wonder, I guess to push you on that: have we overlearned the lessons from Iraq where, you know, we don't - you know the American public is tired and is sort of worrying about anything that even resembles an intervention, whether it's humanitarian or on the military side?
Ambassador Power: Well, again, I have sympathy for the public given the number of lives, American lives, that have been lost in Iraq and Afghanistan and the kind of sacrifice that the families of service members have made just tour after tour after tour. I can only imagine what it's like, you know, to be a spouse in a family like that and the challenges. So that's just on the service member side. And then the public, generally, has seen a lot of resources expended.
So I think that, as I said, I think probably in that speech, there is a healthy skepticism and the risks of using military force are so significant - for our men and women, for the individuals in the country in question - there are so many unpredictable consequences when you use force that there should be a lot of layers and a lot of checks and balances. At the same time, there are really profound threats to our national security that exist on the global stage today, whether it's a movement - the first terrorist movement, the first of its kind that controls territory, controls oil fields, you know, made use of heavy weaponry. I mean, that is the kind of terrorist juggernaut that the American people understood we couldn't tolerate; we couldn't see them just continuing to execute and convert their way through the Middle East, you know, now every American they may encounter vulnerable to their wrath. And so I think the support, notwithstanding the fatigue, notwithstanding the drain of this long enterprise both in Iraq and Afghanistan, you see support for a mission that the United States and the American people know, you know, is necessary for our national interest.
I think one of the reasons you see support is because we also mobilized other countries. I think when the American people see - and I hear, I've heard this a lot from both sides of the aisle up on Capitol Hill as we've engaged on ISIL and on Ebola - is they really want to see, well what's everyone else doing? When we show up, okay, that's one thing we get it, we've got the lead, we're America, and we want the lead. But, you know, people don't like the free rider problem in the international system. And so that's where I have the perfect job because that's my day job, is to try to break through the free rider problem, the collective action challenges and get countries to step up with us.

Nov 15, 2014 (Daily Independent/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- There are many of my friends who will be shocked if I say to them that Goodluck Jonathan may easily be re-elected president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2015 even without rigging. I know those among them who will say, Tufiakwa!
There are many Nigerians who are certain that GEJ has used up the good luck he was given at birth and even the good luck that he may have borrowed. As far as they are concerned, Jonathan is out of luck, no longer credit worthy and should leave Nigeria alone and just go back to his village with Mama P.
If you cared to listen to them, they will vomit a thousand reasons why Nigeria's luckiest politician of all times has run out of luck. On top of the list of the charges is of course, Boko Haram, which has openly challenged the Jonathan government to a fight and has so far won every single round of the battle.
Everywhere in the world I go to, people ask me, ""how is it that Boko Haram has slaughtered thousands of Nigerians in cold blood while your government appears helpless and out of step?"" Some wonder aloud: What happened that your Commander-in -Chief cannot command the once feared Nigerian army to go and teach Boko Haram a lesson?
Come to think of it, is this not the same Nigerian army that fought the highly cerebral and creative Ojukwu and brought his Biafran army to a standstill? Pray, is this not the same army that went to Liberia and taught Charles Taylor, the butcher, that except he left Monrovia, the butcher would become the butchered? Did the Nigerian Army not bring to a halt the shameless diamond trade in Sierra Leone, which caused a war that sent thousands to their death? Suddenly no one is exactly sure that if push comes to shove, Nigeria can take on the army of the tiny Republic of Benin or the Togolese army. What exactly has gone wrong?
Some of my friends and please they are not members of APC (All progressives Congress), are already asking how the President of Nigeria had the boldness to organise a jamboree in Abuja to seek re-election a mere 24 hours after the massacre of 47 young Nigerian students in Potiskum, Yobe State. Things are not helped by that crazy announcement some weeks ago that Nigeria had agreed to a 'cease fire' with Boko Haram and that the abducted Chibok girls were set to be released. Has whoever authorised that announcement not exposed Nigeria to untold international shame and embarrassment? Now it appears like someone had done one massive scam on the Nigerian nation. How much Nigeria paid the scammer and his partners, we will never know.
There are of course those who have had enough of Jonathan because they say that corruption has run amok under his watch and indeed has become part of the directive principle of state policy entrenched in the Nigerian constitution. Such people point to TAN (Transformation Ambassadors of Nigeria) and wonder where the shapeless and hitherto unknown organisation got the billions it is spreading like confetti all over the place to re-elect Jonathan, the kind of money no counting machine can count.
There are of course others who will point to the millions of Nigerian men and women who are jobless, helpless and hopeless. Do you want to mention those who are very upset that even with the scrapping of NEPA and the massive jump in their electricity bills, Nigeria still wallows in darkness? There are many reasons to wish that Jonathan will just go away. Even the Super Eagles, which used to provide Nigerians something to thump their chest about have lost their mojo. Nigeria is now being beaten by Sudan and Congo! Abomination!
Regardless of the huge moaning, grumbling and complaining, in May 2015, Nigerians might discover that they still have to live with a President Jonathan for another four years and this has nothing to do with rigging. Go ahead and make as much fun of her as you like but Mama P may have the last laugh as she retains occupancy of the main bedroom at Aso Rock, something which a lot of Nigerian women who think they are smarter than her will never achieve.
 

How is it possible that this can come true with Nigerians humbled like never before? After last week's drubbing of the Democrats by Republicans in the U.S. midterm elections, President Obama confessed that he may have got the policy right and the politics wrong. As I wrote last week, Americans are buying houses again, the Dow Jones just keeps setting new all-time records, unemployment is down to about six percent, interest rate is as low as they have ever been, Inflation is nowhere to be seen, GM and Chrysler are churning out new cars and making profit again. For the first time in American history, practically every citizen who wants health insurance can get it despite the initial problems with the Obamacare web site. Still, the democrats were badly beaten up last week at the elections. Those who think that in politics, you get rewarded for the good job you have done should bury the thought. Politics is a game without rules. Jonathan may have got the policy wrong but the politics right. As I wrote in my last piece, in the world of the Internet and a thousand television channels, very few have the time to read literature and statistics. Optics is king. While Nigerians may be unhappy with the guy who had no shoes, they are not scared of him. There are many who may think that this soft-spoken guy is not up to the job but they do not think of him as an extremist. In other words, they can live with him. At the end of the day, his supposed weakness may indeed be his strength. People don't trust politicians and many people consider every election as a choice between two evils. When all is said and done, the next elections will be a contest between Jonathan and whoever the opposition, APC produces. Those who know APC's Muhammadu Buhari well will swear to his discipline and his ability to get things done, something that Nigeria badly needs. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has however done a good job of clothing Buhari in an extremist toga and without any shred of evidence making him a religious fundamentalist. In churches all over Nigeria, this whispering campaign never stops. If Buhari becomes the APC candidate, does APC have the resources and time to remake the General? If Atiku Abubakar were to make it as the APC candidate, how will he be marketed? I am really not sure because of his very close hobnobbing with the PDP. Will he wash with those who want to get rid of Jonathan? Won't he be seen as a bird of the same feather? Then, there is Aminu Tambuwal, the new kid on the bloc. I hear he is a smart politician. He is already being called 'Tammy' on the Internet. Is he the young man with the magic to take on the PDP juggernaut and turn Nigeria around? More on this subject, later.

""My government appeals to the council to extend the mandate of UNMIL [UN Mission in Liberia] for the full one year period,"" Ambassador Marjon Kamara told the council. Kamara said that her country had not fully recovered from the Ebola crisis to be able to ""withstand drastic changes,"" warning that the Ebola epidemic was still threatening Liberia's ""peace, security and social cohesion."" UNMIL was established by the UN Security Council in September 2003 to support a ceasefire agreement signed by Liberia's warring parties in August 2003. The mission also supports national security reform, including police and military training. The council decided in September 2012 to gradually reduce the numbers from about 7,950 to 3,750 by July 2015. Currently, the mission has around 5,948 uniformed personnel. On September 15, the council postponed the drawdown until December 31, in a bid to beef up international response to the Ebola outbreak there. ""A strong international presence in our country was important then,"" Kamara said.

12 November 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"12 November 2014 Manila Bulletin MABULL English (c) 2014 Manila Bulletin Publishing Corp. All rights reserved. The 133-strong 18th Filipino Contingent who served in the UN peacekeeping force for almost a year in Liberia will be arriving early evening tomorrow (Wednesday) at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay city on board UTair Aviation from Monrovia, Liberia.
All 133 returning troops have passed the Ebola screening test that was conducted by UN doctors, a mandatory requirement for peacekeepers due for repatriation.
But despite being Ebola-free, Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. Gregorio Pio P. Catapang Jr. said the returning troops will still have to follow protocol.
The Filipino mission is composed of 108 military personnel, 24 PNP personnel who served as part of the UN police, and a member of the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) who served as a UN staff officer.
But not all peacekeepers are home. There are still four who will be left behind for a few days to take care of AFP-owned equipment that will have to be flown back. They will undergo Ebola screening test three days before they leave for the Philippines.
Catapang said the returning troops who have been certified Ebola-free belong to the ""no risk"" category of Ebola infection.
To dispel any fears, Catapang said ""our troops have no direct contact with any Ebola victim. Their work is concentrated inside the force headquarters of the United Nations mission in Liberia.""
ONLY WAVE, NO EMBRACE
Upon arrival, the peacekeepers will be allowed to see their families - but only from a distance.
""We will set up a grandstand at the Villamor Air Base. Unfortunately, we placed a cordon. The minimum actually is 15 meters but it's more than enough space, they can see, they can smile, and wave to their loves ones. Wala munang touching,"" said Air Force spokesman Col. Enrico Canaya.
""Hindi ito ginagawa dahil they are infected. We want it to make it clear so that the families, the public is assured that we are undertaking everything possible in order to make sure the country remains Ebola-free,"" said AFP spokesman Maj. Gen. Domingo Tutaan.
From Villamor, the troops will be taken by bus to a naval base and be transported by ship to the nearby Caballo island where they will be quarantined for 21 days.
The AFP chief asked for understanding of the families and loved ones of the peacekeepers for their extended absence.
Catapang also appealed for understanding from the families of the returning troopers. ""I would like to ask your patience for extending the absence of your loved ones. I have done everything to make their stay at the island paradise of Caballo, a very pleasant and memorable one,"" he said.
The AFP said both Smart and Globe Communications have expanded their cellular network coverage in order to provide telecom services for the peacekeepers during their 21-day quarantine in Caballo Island.
Smart Communications has set up free WiFi facility to allow the peacekeepers to use Internet services with 3G signal and link up with their families.
 

Catapang also said they are working closely with the Department of Health's Bureau of Quarantine, Health Emergency Management Bureau, and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine during troops' stay at the island. ""After the quarantine period, the AFP will schedule a hero's welcome for all our gallant peacekeepers in recognition to their outstanding accomplishments while serving the United Nations,"" said Catapang. The UN peacekeeping force in Liberia was set up in 2003 to support a civil war ceasefire.

New York, Nov 10, 2014 (United States Department of State/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -Remarks by Ambassador Samantha Power, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, at the American Enterprise Institute on UN Peacekeeping Reform
Hello everybody. I have come here today to talk about UN peacekeeping. There is a lot going on in the world right now. Elie Wiesel once - quite recently - shared with me the following thought: ""The winds of madness are blowing."" And I know that's how it feels. But the urgent, critical issues on our plate should not divert us from an important fact, which is that the United States has a vital interest - and a critical role to play - in strengthening peacekeeping to meet demands that peacekeepers are currently struggling to meet around the world.
I start from a basic premise: conflicts in faraway places matter in various ways to the United States. These conflicts matter because we recognize that violence within any particular country can quickly cause national and regional instability, displacing millions of people, upending markets, and spilling over into neighboring countries. Conflicts undo the hard-earned progress countries have made toward building democracy, they weaken both governments and civil society, and they allow criminals and repressors to thrive.
They also matter because the instability created by these conflicts increasingly attracts extremist groups, who can use the vacuum of authority to terrorize civilian populations and plan and launch attacks. The suffering caused by these conflicts can be a powerful recruitment tool. Even conflicts that are not fueled at the outset by extremist elements can attract and foster them. Or, because state authority breaks down, places of conflict can be comfortable places for extremists to hang out, unmolested. Whether it be Darfur, Mali, or the Central African Republic, we ignore these crises at our peril.
Not only does curbing violent conflict make us safer, it is also consistent with what our hearts tell us is right. A number of public opinion polls have shown that large majorities of Americans support action to prevent mass atrocities from occurring in other parts of the world.
We do not want to live in a world where more than 9,000 kids are recruited in less than a year to become child soldiers, as has happened recently in South Sudan. We do not want to live in a world where religious or ethnic communities who lived together for decades in harmony, such as the Muslims and Christians in the Central African Republic, learn to hate and fear and demonize one another. Neither do America's foreign policy leaders: the possible next Chairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Armed Services Committee, Senators Corker and McCain, have long been strong advocates on preventing such atrocities. So have the Committees' current Chairs: Senators Menendez and Levin.
Recognizing that our security and our values prevent us from ignoring these conflicts, the question is: what should America do to stop them?
The United States has a lot that we must do right now. We have a lot on our plate. Our troops are fighting ISIL in the Middle East; they are deployed to West Africa to beat back Ebola; and they continue to serve valiantly in Afghanistan - all this even as we face substantial budget cuts. Crises from eastern Ukraine to Gaza continue to cascade on the broader foreign policy horizon. As President Obama said at West Point, ""America must always lead on the world stage,"" but ""we should not go it alone.""
Even if the United States has an interest in seeing conflict abate or civilians protected, that does not mean that U.S. forces should be doing all of the abating or the protecting. We shouldn't. It should go without saying that we cannot, and we should not, send the U.S. military into all of the places where conflict is burning, civilians are hurting, or extremists are lurking. Just because we have far and away the most capable military in the world, does not mean we should assume risks and burdens that should be shared by the broader international community.
 

This is where peacekeeping comes in. When conflicts in Congo, Mali, or South Sudan require boots on the ground to defuse conflict - peacekeeping is often the best instrument we have. Peacekeeping operations ensure that other countries help shoulder the burden, both by contributing troops and sharing the financial costs of operations. Provided that peacekeepers actually deliver on their mandates, multilateral peacekeeping also brings a degree of legitimacy in the eyes of the local population: because missions are made up of troops from multiple countries, with strong representation from the Global South, spoilers and militants have a harder time cynically branding them as having imperialist designs.
Even in places where the United States has decided to deploy troops, we've benefitted from being able to hand off to the United Nations - as we did in Haiti - allowing the peacekeeping operation, then, to provide longer-term support for security, rule of law, and political transition.
The multilateral nature of peacekeeping helps address the free-rider problem we see today in so many matters of international security - from the spread of Ebola, to the rise of ISIL, to the recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters - whereby countries with vested interests in addressing threats rely on the United States to do the lion's share of the work. Peacekeeping gets other countries to stand up, rather than stand by.
So, we start from the premise that - in a world where we have a vested interest in seeing violent conflicts curbed and seeing suffering prevented - America needs peacekeeping to work. But precisely at this moment, when we recognize this crucial role that peacekeeping can play in shoring up U.S. interests, our demands on peacekeeping are outstripping what it can deliver.
Today, we are asking peacekeepers to do more, in more places, and in more complex conflicts than at any time in history.
There are currently sixteen UN peacekeeping missions worldwide, made up of nearly 130,000 personnel, at least 100,000 of them are uniformed military and police, compared to just 75,000 total personnel a decade ago. That's not to mention the more than 20,000 peacekeepers fighting in the African Union's mission in Somalia. To stress, this is by far the most peacekeepers that have ever been active in history. And yet the numbers only tell a small part of the story.
The strain on the system would be challenging enough if we were asking peacekeepers simply to do what they used to do - to monitor ceasefires between two consenting states. But we're giving peacekeepers broad and increasingly demanding responsibilities in increasingly inhospitable domains. We are asking them to contain - and at times, even disarm - violent groups, like the countless rebel groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We're asking them to ensure safe delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance, such as by escorting emergency shipments of food and medicine to civilians, as peacekeepers have done in South Sudan. We are asking them to protect civilians from atrocities, such as those being carried out in the Central African Republic. And we are asking them to help provide stability in countries emerging from brutal civil wars, as in Liberia. And in virtually all of these missions, we are asking them to carry out these duties in countries where governments are extremely weak, and often unable to meet the basic needs of their citizens.
Today, two-thirds of UN peacekeepers are operating in active conflict areas, the highest percentage ever. Peacekeepers often deploy to areas where myriad rebel groups and militias have made clear that they intend to keep fighting. And the warring parties in modern conflicts increasingly include violent extremist groups, who terrorize civilians and view peacekeepers - openly treat peacekeepers as legitimate targets.
But precisely at this moment - when we're asking more of peacekeeping than ever before, and as we recognize the crucial role that it can play - we see both the promise and the pitfalls of contemporary peacekeeping. We see life-saving impact when peacekeepers are willing and able to fulfill their mandates, and we see the devastating consequences when they are not. A few examples:
In South Sudan, where a new civil war has displaced over a million people and killed more than 10,000 just since last December, the UN peacekeeping mission has arguably played a critical role in preventing even more bloodshed. On December 15th, the day that infighting between President Kiir and former Vice-President Machar sent the country spiraling into horrific violence, government soldiers went house-to-house searching for ethnic Nuer men and executing them in the streets. In one incident, soldiers crammed between two and three hundred Nuer men into a small building and then opened fire on them through the windows, killing nearly all of them. In the city of Bor, rebel forces repeatedly targeted the homes of ethnic Dinka, executing the unarmed inhabitants and looting their cattle and other possessions.
In response to the onset of violence, the UN opened the gates of its bases to civilians fleeing the violence, eventually taking in more than 100,000 displaced persons. On a Security Council trip to South Sudan I took in August, I visited the UN base in Malakal, where more than 17,000 people were taking shelter. Rough as the conditions were for the people on the base - and they were rough, many of them were living in foot-deep, filthy water - they told me that at least they had access to food and clean drinking water and protection from deadly attacks, which was more than could be said for the South Sudanese outside of the gates. Two
 

decades earlier, recall, when civilians sought refuge under the UN flag, peacekeepers made a different choice. In April 1994, some 2,000 Rwandan Tutsi had sought refuge in the Don Bosco School in Kigali, which UN peacekeepers were using as a base. Hutu militia had surrounded the school, chanting ""Hutu power! Hutu power!"" drinking banana beer, and brandishing machetes. Yet when orders came for the peacekeepers to evacuate, they followed orders. They had to shoot over the heads of Tutsi in order to get out - so resistant were the people to letting them go. And not long after the peacekeepers walked out of the school, militia members walked in, butchering virtually everyone inside.
That was then, now we have the UN mission in South Sudan opening its gates and staying with the people at a time of great need. At the same time, South Sudan today demonstrates the continuing challenge of rapidly deploying peacekeepers and the equipment that they need. At the outset of this December conflict, which continues to this day, the Security Council swiftly authorized an emergency surge of 5,500 troops, nearly doubling the number of troops there on the ground in South Sudan. Yet almost one year later, the mission today is still more than 2,000 troops short, severely restricting the mission's ability to project force and provide security for civilians outside the camps. It has also suffered from a chronic shortage of helicopters. And in fact, as some of you may know, there is a shortfall of more than 30 helicopters across UN missions, consistently restricting mobility and effectiveness, often in life-or-death situations.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, there is similar good news-bad news. After years of stagnancy, the UN mission there has played a really important role in the last year - year-and-a-half - in disarming and defeating powerful rebel groups. Alongside Congolese forces, this effort has been led by a special unit of the mission known as the Force Intervention Brigade. The Brazilian UN force commander, Lieutenant General Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz - who has been absolutely critical to a heightened emphasis on preventing atrocities - he told fellow peacekeeping commanders at a recent Security Council meeting to change their mindset, and to stop reporting ""just what happened yesterday"" and instead start reporting ""what we did yesterday,"" so the accountability is for what we did in the face of what is happening. And the brigade under dos Santos Cruz has put these convictions into action, neutralizing a number of powerful rebel groups, including the M23, which had committed unspeakable atrocities against Congolese civilians. General Santos Cruz has set an example by putting himself on the front lines of this aggressive effort, participating in patrols with his troops, and even traveling personally to the headquarters of one rebel group to tell its leaders to lay down their arms or face a frontal assault. This is not your mother or your grandmother's peacekeeping.
And yet even with this singular leadership we still see UN peacekeepers in Congo fairly routinely failing to protect civilians. On the evening of June 6th, armed assailants attacked civilians at an outdoor church service in the Congolese town of Mutarule. Many people called the nearby UN base - which was only five miles away - they were begging for help, in some instances they were using the free phones that peacekeepers had provided them for just such an emergency. Yet the peacekeepers sat at their base, later claiming that they thought that local Congolese military commanders would intervene. More than 30 people were massacred, eight of them kids. One victim was a four-year-old boy with mental and physical disabilities, who was burned to death.
These are the stakes of what gets done right and what gets done wrong - or not done, in this case. This incident in Congo is unfortunately not an isolated case - even though the protection of civilians has moved to the heart of contemporary mission mandates. A report by the UN's internal oversight office in March found that in 507 attacks against civilians from 2010 to 2013, peacekeepers virtually never used force to protect civilians under attack. Thousands of civilians may have lost their lives as a result. And this is unacceptable.
In Mali, during the nine months in 2012 and 2013 that extremist groups controlled towns in the North, a teenage girl was whipped 60 times in the streets of Timbuktu for daring to talk to young boys. Music was banned, major mausoleums demolished, and libraries burned. Today, peacekeepers are playing a critical role, alongside the French, to help root out extremists. UN peacekeepers have helped to provide Malians with the security and assurance they needed to return to their communities, reducing the number of internally displaced persons in Mali by more the sixty percent in the past year. And the peacekeepers' presence has prevented extremists from retaking key cities and towns, such as Timbuktu, where the community is reconstituting its long tradition of religious tolerance and rebuilding its ravaged holy sites.
At the same time though, the peacekeeping mission in Mali faces serious challenges in projecting force over the vast territory north of the Niger River. The mission has struggled to move troops, to establish base camps and sustain them in an austere environment with unusable roads. The mission has had to spend millions of dollars just to transport water to its troops in that environment. Worst of all, UN troops are also facing unprecedented attacks by extremists. Just to give a few examples: on August 16th, a suicide bomber drove a pick-up truck laden with explosives into the heart of a UN camp in the town of Ber and detonated its load. Two Burkinabe peacekeepers were killed, and seven others were wounded. On September 18th, five Chadian peacekeepers were killed when their truck drove over an IED. And on October 3rd, men armed with RPGs on motorbikes ambushed a UN logistics convoy traveling to resupply troops in the field, killing 9 peacekeepers from Niger. Suffice it to say, when the UN created peacekeeping six decades ago, it did not have suicide bombers or IEDs in mind.
 

Now when we deploy peacekeepers into some of the most complex conflicts of our time, and deploy a rather low number of troops proportional to the tasks that they are being assigned, some of these problems would likely be evident even if the world's most advanced militaries were the ones wearing blue helmets.
Regardless, the problems I've described - slow troop deployment, limited mobility, the challenge of keeping units fed and hydrated in remote areas, and the failure to confront aggressors and protect civilians - are problems that are in the U.S. interest to see addressed. I would like to share four ways that the United States and our partners can strengthen peacekeeping so it can better meet the demands of 21st century conflicts.
First, the pool of countries that deploy troops, police, and military enablers has to expand. UN peacekeeping is increasingly funded by developed countries and manned by developing countries. This is unsustainable and unfair. It will not produce the peacekeeping forces that today's conflicts and our national security demand. And it perpetuates divisions between the two camps, when in reality we have a shared interest in seeing peacekeeping succeed.
That is why Vice President Biden convened world leaders at the UN General Assembly in September for a Peacekeeping Summit, to press for more commitments from capable militaries and to demonstrate our common cause with those who are performing this dangerous task. We are encouraging European militaries, many of which are drawing down from Afghanistan, to return to UN peacekeeping where they played a very active role in the 1990's. We're urging Latin American militaries to deploy outside the Western Hemisphere. And we're asking East Asian militaries to contribute more substantially to peacekeeping, some for the first time. These countries will not only bring more troops to UN peacekeeping operations, but also potentially niche capabilities - such as the surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities that the Dutch and Nordic troops are now bringing to the UN mission in Mali, which should help prevent deadly attacks on peacekeepers and civilians, like the ones that have taken the lives of more than 30 peacekeepers in Mali in the last year.
At the September summit, many of our partners answered the U.S. and the UN call. Colombia announced its intent to deploy its highly capable troops, which have benefitted over the years from U.S. training, to UN peacekeeping. Japan announced that it will change its domestic legislation to permit greater participation in peacekeeping. Indonesia announced that it will more than double its deployment of troops to UN peacekeeping operations and create a standby force to permit rapid deployment. More than two dozen other countries, from Sweden to Chile to China, made new commitments. We will continue to urge new contributions over the coming year, and world leaders will reconvene in September 2015 to make new pledges to peacekeeping.
As for our own military, in addition to our high profile military efforts in Afghanistan, against ISIL, and against Ebola, the United States also contributes about 1,400 troops to the multinational peacekeeping force in Sinai and the NATO mission in Bosnia. But as Vice President Biden announced at the summit, we are reviewing whether there are gaps that the United States is uniquely positioned to fill. That includes providing critical airlift for UN or AU peacekeepers and building base camps, as we currently are doing for the mission in the Central African Republic. We are also doing more to share our unique knowledge of confronting asymmetric threats, like the ones that peacekeepers are confronting in Mali and Somalia, lessons we learned through more than a decade of war in Afghanistan. And we are doing more to help peacekeeping missions make better use of advanced technology, such as counter-IED equipment, which can improve peacekeepers' ability to project force and to save lives.
Our second goal in this effort is to ensure that countries with the will to perform 21st century peacekeeping have the capacity they need to do so. Because African leaders see first-hand the consequences of unchecked conflicts, several have been at the forefront of embracing a new approach to peacekeeping: seeking to aggressively execute the tasks assigned to peacekeepers and, in particular, the responsibility to protect civilians. The African Union has demonstrated a commitment to building rapid response capability on the continent and the United States is leading a coalition of international partners in support.
To this end, in August, President Obama announced a new initiative at the U.S.-Africa Leaders' Summit: the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership, A-Prep. The United States will invest $110 million each year for the next three to five years to build the capacity of a core group of six countries - Ethiopia, Ghana, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. And we are hopeful that our allies in NATO and elsewhere will join this partnership to increase and deepen these capabilities.
The idea is to deepen our investment in those militaries that have a track record of deploying troops to peacekeeping operations and that make a commitment to protecting civilians from violence. To give just one example, Rwanda's troops were among the first boots on the ground when conflict erupted in the Central African Republic. Rwandans understand the importance of getting peacekeeping right, having experienced the catastrophic consequences of it going terribly wrong twenty years ago. And because Rwandans robustly enforce their mission mandates, the people in countries where they serve trust them; troops from other countries who serve alongside them in UN peacekeeping see what robust peacekeeping looks like; and aggressors who would attack civilians fear them.
 

The United States has trained hundreds of thousands of peacekeepers in the past decade through the Global Peace Operations Initiative, launched under President Bush. A-Prep is an important supplement to that effort. Our military experts will work alongside partners like Rwanda to strengthen their institutions and capabilities so they can rapidly deploy troops when crises emerge, and so that they can supply and sustain their forces in hostile and inhospitable environments. In exchange for this support, these countries have committed to maintain the forces and the equipment necessary to undertake rapid deployment.
Third, we need to build a global consensus in support of the mandates peacekeepers are being asked to undertake. The Security Council first tasked a peacekeeping mission with the responsibility to protect civilians in Sierra Leone in 1999 - in the face of that brutal civil war in their country. Today, 10 missions - constituting almost 98 percent of UN troops across the world - are charged with protecting civilians. However, a number of large troop-contributors openly express skepticism at the scope of responsibilities that the Security Council has assigned their troops. These countries cite the traditional principles of peacekeeping - operating with the consent of the parties, remaining impartial between the parties, and using limited force. This approach is understandable. Many of the countries that subscribe to this view served in some of the earliest peacekeeping missions - in which blue helmets were deployed at the invitation of warring parties to observe a ceasefire along a demarcated line, such as one between Israel and Syria, or India and Pakistan. In that context, it was absolutely vital that peacekeepers had the state parties' consent, that they behaved impartially, and that they observed and reported infractions.
But for more than twenty years, peacekeeping has steadily evolved, and we must question how relevant these principles remain to places like Mali and South Sudan, where peacekeepers are called on to defend peace and protect civilians. As Ethiopia's Prime Minister recently argued, we cannot ask extremist groups for their ""consent,"" remain ""impartial"" between legitimate governments and brutal militias, or restrict peacekeepers to using force in self-defense while mass atrocities are taking place around them.
If peacekeeping is to be effective in the 21st century, we have to close the gap between the mandates the international community asks peacekeepers to undertake, and their willingness to successfully execute those mandates. If we don't, it not only puts the lives of civilians and peacekeepers at risk, but undermines the credibility and legitimacy of peacekeeping everywhere.
Recently, some of the largest and longest-serving troop contributors have demonstrated a willingness to tackle this issue head-on. Over the last year, Bangladesh has conducted a comprehensive internal review to craft a new peacekeeping strategy, aimed at adapting to the demands of contemporary peacekeeping. It has recognized the evolution of peacekeeping and pledged to make the protection of civilians an essential component of its troops' training. Meanwhile, earlier this year, Pakistan swiftly removed a sector commander who failed to deploy his troops to protect civilians under attack, and that sent a message to Pakistan's some 8,000 peacekeepers worldwide that such inaction was not condoned. Just last week, Pakistan declared at the UN that it was committed to ""robust peacekeeping to protect civilians.""
Translating these shifts in posture into unity of purpose will take time, but these are promising steps, and we will work with our partners and the UN to encourage more like them. In turn, we must take seriously and seek to remedy the troop-contributing countries' understandable frustration that they lack sufficient opportunity to share with the Security Council the practical experience of their troops on the ground to taking on complex and robust mandates which put in harm's way their men and women in uniform.
Fourth, we need to press the UN to make bold institutional reforms. It is easy to criticize the UN for all the problems we see on the ground. But at the same time we create much needed accountability for failures, and for abuses, we should take note of some profound changes that the UN Secretariat has made to peacekeeping since the catastrophic failures of Rwanda and Srebrenica. From doctrinal changes that recognize the new responsibilities of peacekeepers; to better systems for the recruitment and deployment of a vast number of military, police, and civilian personnel; to improved logistics and procurement - the United Nations has made some advances. Last year, we spearheaded the effort to enact further reforms, including longer troop rotations to preserve institutional memory, financial penalties for troops who show up without the necessary equipment to perform their duties, and financial premiums for troops who are willing to accept higher risks. Incentives and disincentives have to be better leveraged in the service of our shared aims.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has just launched a new strategic review of peacekeeping, the first in nearly 15 years. While we don't expect a mere review to remedy deficiencies in capabilities and shortages in political will, the review should address those shortcomings in peacekeeping that the UN itself, the UN Secretariat as distinct from the UN member states, has the ability itself to fix: inadequate planning, slow troop deployment, uneven mission leadership, unclear and unenforced standards for troop performance, inadequate measures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse, insufficient accountability for failures to protect civilians, and an inefficient division of labor between peacekeeping operations and other UN agencies.
Most of the issues that I've just described, the UN Secretariat can take a strong leadership role. Member states then in turn have to step up, you have to have both for the reforms that are needed to kick in and make
 

a difference. These four lines of effort are all critical to ensuring peacekeeping better addresses 21st century challenges. They demonstrate the need for U.S. leadership, and to exercise that leadership, the United States must pay our UN dues in full.
I understand the frustration that many Americans feel with the United States paying a substantial share of the peacekeeping budget, and with the U.S. share rising over the past decade due to the formula that the United States negotiated back in the year 2000, which allowed our regular budget contribution share to be capped. We agree that the formula should be changed to reflect the realities of today's world. Until that happens, we also insist on paying our full dues at this critical moment - if we do not, we will dramatically undercut our power to achieve the reforms needed, we will undermine our leadership, and we will potentially underfund important African-led missions, such as the ones in Mali and the Central African Republic.
This does not mean we simply sign over a large check and look the other way. On the contrary, as stewards of taxpayer funds, over the last six years we have pressed hard to improve the cost-efficiency of peacekeeping and to prevent significant new costs. Through U.S.-led reform efforts, the UN has cut the per-peacekeeper costs by roughly 16 percent - that's one-sixth of the cost reduced through efficiencies and streamlining. We've also aggressively fought cost increases, saving hundreds of millions of dollars per year by prevailing on other countries for a more modest increase in the long-frozen reimbursement rates for UN peacekeepers. And we've pressed to streamline and right-size missions, where warranted, by changing conditions on the ground. In the Ivory Coast, we've cut the number of mandated troops in half, from 10,000 to around 5,000. In Haiti, we have reduced the number of mandated troops from nearly 9,000 after the 2010 earthquake to just over 2,000 today. And we were on course to do the same in Liberia prior to the outbreak of Ebola. These efforts ensure that governments do not use peacekeepers as an excuse not to take responsibility for their own citizens' security. And streamlining missions in this manner frees up troops and resources that are needed elsewhere.
We will continue to work relentlessly to make peacekeeping as efficient as possible without undermining its effectiveness, in close coordination with Congress. As Congress reconvenes next week to consider a spending bill, I plan to continue working with a bipartisan group of lawmakers to find a path forward on this critically important issue.
Before closing, let me just touch briefly on a trip President Obama asked me to take last week to take stock of the international response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Long before Ebola hit Sierra Leone and Liberia, brutal civil wars did. And both nations subsequently hosted UN peacekeeping missions. The UN's mission in Liberia, UNMIL, is ongoing.
When UN peacekeepers arrived in Sierra Leone in 1999, the ceasefire between warring parties was shaky. More than 50,000 people had been killed, and rebel groups had amputated the limbs of 20,000 people. Over the next six years, the UN Sierra Leone Mission was performing a lot like the contemporary missions I described earlier. It suffered some very serious failures and setbacks, including credible allegations of an outrageous pattern of sexual abuse by troops. And less than a year after the mission deployed, rebels kidnapped hundreds of peacekeepers, killed four of them, and renounced their ceasefire with the government.
But talk to Sierra Leoneans, as I did last week, and they recall as well a mission that had an outsized impact in helping Sierra Leone rebuild after an utterly devastating conflict. Peacekeepers helped to disarm at least 75,000 ex-fighters, including hundreds of child soldiers, who then they helped reintegrate into families and communities once again; the blue helmets decommissioned more than 42,000 weapons; they helped half a million displaced people return to their communities. And after providing security for the country's first-ever democratic presidential election in 2005, the UN peacekeeping mission was drawn down.
One of the questions that kept running through my mind as I toured Freetown last week was: what if UN peacekeepers had never come to Sierra Leone? What if the country had still been at war when the Ebola outbreak struck? How much faster would the virus have spread? How would doctors and nurses have been able to flood the country to support the country's weak health system right now? How would Sierra Leone's military have been able to help build Ebola Treatment Units or run safe burial operations, as they are now doing, if they were tied down fighting rebels? We rarely ask these questions of peacekeeping.
We see the many many ways that peacekeepers come up short: the slowness to deploy, the failures to protect civilians, the abuses, the list goes on. But what we cannot see - what is impossible to see - is the counterfactual. What would any of the more than a dozen countries where UN peacekeepers are deployed today look like without a peacekeeping presence?
And when the missions do their jobs, as the Sierra Leone peacekeeping mission did in many ways, they make themselves obsolete. They draw down. Troops come home, not to parades - in spite of having risked their lives for people from nations that are not their own - they come home to anonymity.
 

Yet this ""what if"" question is one we must ask ourselves with every mission. What would have happened in South Sudan if no UN peacekeepers had been present when Dinka and Nuer began going door-to-door and killing people on the basis of their ethnicity; or if the UN had not opened its gates to those 100,000 people fleeing this violence? What would the Central African Republic look like today if no African Union or European Union peacekeepers, now UN peacekeepers, had come to try to prevent attacks by the anti-Balaka and Seleka militias, who were massacring civilians with abandon? In all of these instances, the answer is a simple: without peacekeeping, the violence and the suffering would likely have been much, much worse. The ""what if"" question doesn't let anybody off the hook, not peacekeepers, not the countries that fund and lift and support peacekeeping and authorize these missions as we have the privilege of doing within the Security Council; not the peacekeeping contributors themselves; not the UN Secretariat - nobody gets off the hook. But it does remind us why this effort is so worthwhile and why American leadership is so critical. Just because places like Sierra Leone, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic are better off than they would have been without peacekeeping, does not mean the institution is where it needs to be. It is not. Nor does it mean that we are satisfied with peacekeepers fulfilling parts, but not all, of their mandates; or with peacekeepers standing up to protect civilians some of the time, rather than all of the time. We are not. When the stakes are as high as they are though in these conflicts - when shortfalls can result in atrocities committed, in communities uprooted, and in entire societies being split along ethnic and religious lines getting it right some of the time is certainly not good enough. Peacekeeping must be consistently performing and meeting our expectations. And we will keep working with our partners to bring about the kinds of reforms upon which the security of millions of people around the world may well depend.

10 November 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"10 November 2014 14:14 Reuters News LBA English Copyright 2014 Thomson Reuters. All Rights Reserved. MANILA (Reuters) - More than 100 Philippine peacekeepers returning from almost a year in Liberia will be put in quarantine on an isolated island on arrival this week to check for Ebola, the military said on Monday, adding there were fears how the public might react.
The 21-day quarantine, on a navy-run island at the mouth of Manila Bay, was in line with World Health Organisation protocols and with government's drive to remain Ebola free, military chief General Gregorio Catapang said.
The death toll from the Ebola epidemic has risen to 4,950 out of 13,241 cases in the three worst-hit countries of West Africa, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, WHO said on Friday, calling for widespread rigorous controls to halt its spread.
""Our peacekeepers belong to no-risk category of the Ebola infection,"" Catapang told a news conference at the main army base in Manila, two days before the arrival of 108 soldiers, 24 police and jail wardens from Monrovia.
""Our troops have no direct contact with any Ebola victim. Their work is concentrated inside the force headquarters of the United Nations mission in Liberia.""
The U.N. peacekeeping force in Liberia was set up in 2003 to support a civil war ceasefire.
Catapang said the Filipino peacekeepers had undergone thorough medical screening by the United Nations. The quarantine was a further precaution imposed by the Philippines, the largest group to be isolated in the current Ebola crisis, he said.
The peacekeepers will arrive at an air base in Manila on Wednesday and travel by bus to a naval base south of Manila and be transported by ship to Caballo island, a naval facility used by the Americans during World War Two.
Families and friends would be brought to the air base but not allowed contact, army Major-General Domingo Tutaan said.
The military was worried about how the public would react to the peacekeepers' return, he told Reuters. To avoid panic, they would not be required to wear masks and protective gear when they arrive.
The Health Ministry has trained hundreds of medical workers and prepared at least 22 hospitals across the country to handle Ebola cases in case the disease reaches the Philippines.

Nov 09, 2014 (Daily Independent/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- ""Not even all the armies in the world can stop an idea whose time has come""-Victor Hugo
The deposed maximum ruler of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore, would by now be licking his wounds at the sea resort in Cote d'Ivoire, where he is currently on forced exile. Compaore resigned on Friday after protests over his attempts to amend the constitution and extend his 27 years in power.
There had been growing unrest over a lack of political reforms and progress in a country rich in gold reserves, but ranked one of the poorest in the world. Under the iron gripped ruler, Burkina Faso has been an influential voice in the region, helping to mediate conflicts and disputes among its neighbours, and is also seen as a strategic ally to the U.S and France.
But, like other despots in the continent, Compaore never knew that the time was up. He forgot that in an increasingly globalised world, citizens are becoming more cynical of their leaders and are therefore more and more prepared to take their destiny into their hands.
For sure, most people, even outside the country, had been waiting for this for long; they had been waiting for a day of reckoning when Compaore would pay for the death of his friend, the late Thomas Sankara, who he killed in a palace coup 27 years ago; they have indeed, been waiting when nemesis would catch up with him to be disgraced from power.
That was exactly what happened few days ago when the people fed up with the scheme of things, uncharacteristically went to the streets and demand his removal.
Like most dictators, Compaore never knew that the game was up; he thought the pockets of protest would fizzle out in few hours; he thought his soldiers will easily quench the thirst for change; he thought he had the people under his pocket as he always did, yet he forgot that ""you can only fool the people some of the time, you can't fool the people all the time"".
Having destroyed the institutions and structures of state, pauperised the people and empowered the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and their comprador collaborators, he entrenched himself in power and wanted to amend the constitution for yet another term. The people would hear none of this and they sent a strong warning to the legislators, many of who also bore the brunt. The pictures of youths facing gun-wielding soldiers on the streets of Ouagadougou resonated around the world in minutes.
The latest events, according to Al Jazeera, are now fueling debate about whether there will be broader consequences for the region and if this will ignite a so-called West African Spring? Only time would tell, but the lessons from the fall of Compaore are very clear: ultimate power resides with the people. You can only toy with it at your own peril!
Of course, there are still many dictators in the continent who have held tight to power for many decades. We still have Robert Mugabe who, after 34 years in power, is said to be grooming his wife to take over; we have Paul Biya of Cameroun, who is not in a hurry to go after many decades in power. There are indeed many of them who still believe that they can stay on the throne forever.
And the tragedy is that they tied their existence, like Louis XVI, to that of the state and would rather want to die in power, than leaving gracefully like the late Nelson Mandela. One can therefore see from the above context that the twin words of ambition and pragmatism are mutually exclusive to African rulers.
What we have seen in the past five decades is that these rulers are so blinded by their ambition that when they eventually fall, like what we saw in Emperor Bukassa of Central Africa Republic; Sekou Toure of Guinea,
 

Mobutu Seseko of Democratic Republic of Congo (Old Zaire), Houphouet Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire, Samuel Doe of Liberia, their countries would end up in civil strife or civil war. We barely escaped one here when former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo wanted to amend the constitution to prolong his stay in office. After eight years in the saddle and with a very powerful presidential structure, Obasanjo thought the country would not move on without him and so wanted to make himself the President for life. Sadly, one of the major beneficiaries of this structure is toeing the same line of ruling with impunity and behaving as if there will be no tomorrow. The current occupant of the number one seat of power, President Goodluck Jonathan, in recent months appears to have turned his back to the lessons of history. For now, he is more engrossed in his ambition than thinking studiously about the future of this country. Nothing bothers him any longer than the realisation of his second term ambition. At least events of the past few days attest to that! I have not seen a clear cut distinction being made between politics and governance. Impunity is rearing its head everywhere. As at the time of writing this piece the security aides of Mallam Aminu Tambuwal, Speaker of the House of Representatives that were withdrawn last week has not been returned, even when the court said both parties should maintain the status quo. It is very unlikely that the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Abba, would act the way he did without presidential directive and rather than deepening the structures and institutions of democracy, the IGP's action has further eroded some of the gains, if any, that have been made since 1999. Aside this vexatious level of impunity, other issues to contend with are insecurity which has reached frightening dimension, with reports that the dreaded sect, Boko Haram has taken more than a dozen local governments in the Northeast. What bothers me more is the sincerity of Abuja to tackle this surge. The federal government has not come out to tell us the truth about the ceasefire agreement between it and sect, validating what the opposition is saying that it was mere fluke. That the so called ceasefire was meant to deceive Nigerians to believe that Aso rock was doing something to create the moral ground for President Jonathan to declare for second term. We also have corruption which has reached an unprecedented level under this administration. Do we still have EFCC? Do the agency still biting? Or is it running after people who cannot account for their wealth? These are the question that should bother all of us. The agency has simply gone to sleep with general election just few months ahead. We now see people who are supposed to be sent to jail campaigning across the country for the president's second term; we have seen AMCON writing off debts of politicians who are in the good books of the president without minding the consequences to the economy. Nothing matters anymore as far as the president's ambition is on the table! America became the envy of the modern world because the first president, George Washington, forgoed his ambition and pitched tent with pragmatism; the late sage; Nelson Mandela became an iconic figure because he was pragmatic enough to serve for only one term, putting his country, South Africa, on sound footing. I am still waiting to see how our politicians would be campaigning if the Chibok girls are still in captivity!","Between Ambition and Pragmatism

Nov 05, 2014 (Daily Trust/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- I am bitter because I cannot help it. I will not understand it if other Nigerians do not feel the same way. But in the height of my anger and bitterness, I can also not help but to, in sincere patriotic zeal, encourage the Nigerian Armed Forces to rise above the mishap of losing territory the size of three states of the federation, reorganize and take on the surmountable task of engaging our growing insurgency.
I worried over Maiduguri. We were warned that the announced ceasefire was a fluke and a fallacy. I feared that Boko Haram was plotting to overrun the Borno State capital. They instead went southwards taking on Adamawa State and, in one fell swoop, overran a reportedly well-stocked military formation and, within an hour, captured Mubi. Mubi, for all practical purposes was only not defended, but escape was everyone for himself - thousands of men, women, students, and children. Yola is currently witnessing a humanitarian disaster will thousands of refugees milling around, and more from Hong, Gombi, and Song townships on the route from Mubi, trooping into the already overcrowded metropolis daily.
A month ago, we were cheered up by the success of efforts of the Nigerian military to turn the tide on insurgents in the ongoing anti-terrorist operation to rescue Borno. The military successfully repelled an insurgents' advance on Konduga. Then last month, it was the story of Adeboyega Obasanjo that truly sparked a flame, even though some officers and men were lost. Adeboyega, a Colonel and son of a former Head of State and President, wounded in battle made me feel comfortable about my own children and relatives, commoners as we are, also presently in battle, making the supreme sacrifice for our country Nigeria. These are the stories I want to hear; that we should hear, not of soldiers fleeing superior power and making tactical manoeuvres. For without doubt, Nigeria's military is one of the finest in the world, with a remarkable track record of lofty global professional attainments.
The problem cannot the lack of courage on the part of the Nigerian soldier. He is reputably courageous, and performs with a high degree of honour and dignity. The Nigerian Military wear their uniforms with pride in defence of their hard earned reputation. In the Congo, Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Liberia, Sierra Leone, the Gambia and Darfur and South Sudan, the Nigerian Military performed with distinction. It is on record that while America failed in Somalia, Nigerian troops restored order and respite before matters deteriorated. The debacle in Mubi like all the others is shameful.
I receive insults and threatening e-mails that castigate me for demands of more firepower against the terrorists. While making excuses for President Goodluck Jonathan, they say the insurgency is an expression of rejection of President Jonathan and it pains me to see the Government being scammed by its functionaries with misinformation on the security situation, which alone seems to explain the glaring inadequacies of the counter insurgency efforts, and the seeming helplessness of the Administration. Suggestions made in good faith are met with denial and politicized. For weeks, Gulak, Madagali, Michika, and Uba had been in the hands of the insurgents, even as fleeing residents were seeking shelter in Yola in hundreds and thousands. Yet Government announced that the insurgents had be routed and the cities, recovered from the insurgents. Then the announcement of a ceasefire came as the height of the delusion. If anything at all, Yoweri Museveni, (Uganda) Charles Taylor, (Sierra Leone), Barak Obama (USA), and indeed Boko Haram have proved that when necessary, you do not have to have been a soldier to wage war. So we can collectively do some thinking.
The pattern of Boko Haram that is clear is that they massively attack cities. But the defence posture of the Nigerian Military is to mount road blocks and engage the insurgents in small platoons. This has ensured that our soldiers were all the time at a disadvantage. Little manned road blocks are suddenly outgunned, overran, and cities are left undefended, hence the fall of city after city.
Boko Haram is able to maintain a steady inflow of weapons, bullets and equipment, much of it, reportedly confiscated from ambushed and routed special forces. It is a no win situation. The road block approach has needed to be modified, to have cities better fortified with more armed military.  

The main problem is the lack of will in the military, committing itself to engaging the insurgents in a manner that can compromise it, weaken it, and defeat it. For this, the President must take decisive action. The buck stops at his table. When a team performs woefully, firing the coach in a feat of anger and frustration makes a lot of sense, more so, a coach or technical crew whose players refuse to obey orders, and simply allow goals. A drastic step that lifts morale and gives spine and muscle to ""the boys"" is pertinent. Unless of course the losses are designed to achieve some clandestine desires of the powers-that-be. How did our Armed Forces so lagged behind in kitting and equipping in spite of the pronounced funding and the seizures from the treasures of the States of the North East under the State of Emergency? What is evident is that Boko Haram seems at a loss what to do when they successfully take territory. Escaped victims from captured enclaves speak only of looting of money and foodstuff, abuse of women and forceful enlistment of child fighters. They do not appear to have ability to set up political structures that provide any social service. Mere terror reigns. Politically, President Jonathan must wear shoes and buckle up for in future, volumes will be written on 'How the Nigerian Military Armed Boko Haram'. The accounts will begin from the known to the unknown, revealing a whole lot. When a General deploys his troops and equipment only in such a way as to allow routing of his men and confiscation of ordinances including tanks and mortars, when troops are ostensibly without rear support which explains tactical retreats, he inadvertently sponsors the enemy. Sadly heroes would be among the dead.","Breaching Our Defence, Like Hot Knife Through Butter

Nov 03, 2014 (The South African Civil Society Information Service/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -""What a stupid idea to announce a ceasefire with Boko Haram, who came up with that? Is it that these people don't think? ...They are eager to announce good news. Elections are coming fast. Announce good news and then make a fool of yourself. Haba. The most stupid part was suggesting a day for the release of the girls.""
This is how a conversation between Ifemelu and Ceiling goes, two characters in Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's novel, Americannah, who also happen to have a real-time blog. Ifemelu and Ceiling are reacting to recent news that the Nigerian government is close to securing the release of 219 schoolgirls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram in Chibok, seven months ago on April 14, 2014. Mike Omeri, coordinator of Nigeria's National Information Centre, told The Guardian newspaper on October 19, that the government was ""inching closer to securing the release of the girls"", who are reportedly held in neighbouring Cameroon.
Yet a week ago, Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported that another 30 girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram on the October 23. (HRW) estimates that Boko Haram has killed 2,053 civilians in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states to date this year.
Much has been said about the snail pace with which Goodluck Jonathan's government responded to the kidnap of the girls in Chibok and the overall lack of strategy in their engagement with Boko Haram, which has been launching military attacks in north-eastern Nigeria since 2009.
The scepticism that the government has suddenly made ""concessions"" with Boko Haram is appropriately met with cynicism, especially as these ""developments"" happen close to a likely announcement by Jonathan that he will be running for re-election in 2015. While Boko Haram has not commented on the supposed truce between itself and the Nigerian government, new details from girls who have managed to escape capture have confirmed the worst of our fears about the kind of treatment they have been subjected to over these months: forced marriage, rape and torture are among the few.
In the post-Cold War and post 9/11 eras, it has long been clear that armed non-state actors target civilians and public infrastructure in non-combatant areas that now form part of the ""battleground"" en route to state capture. Boko Haram has made it clear that it seeks to capture the Nigerian state.
While in the post-Cold War era a group like Boko Haram may have been labelled ""rebels"", similar to those seen in the wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo or Liberia/Sierra Leone, in the post-9/11 era, such a group is subsumed under the label of ""terrorist"".
Since 2012, Boko Haram has been classified as a terrorist organisation under the Nigerian Terrorism Prevention Act of 2011. During the group's initial founding in 2002, it was alleged to be connected to the Taliban and was subsequently given the name of ""Nigerian Taliban"", although no actual links between itself and the Taliban in Afghanistan were proven. In later years, it has been linked to Al-Qaeda and alleged to be getting funding from groups in Saudi-Arabia and the United Kingdom.
These categories of ""rebel"" versus ""terrorist"" have material consequences for how states react to these armed non-state actors. ""Terrorist"" reduces groups like Boko Haram and indeed, Al Shabaab in Somalia, to mere religious fundamentalists without political ideology.
More than that, it presents the grievances of such a group in an outward frame, where details about Boko Haram members allegedly receiving training in Mali in a Tuareg rebel group and in Somalia under Al Shabaab are meant to alert us to the group's greater commitment and location within a global jihadist network. It therefore becomes difficult to classify Nigeria as a country at war, or, at the very least, a highly militarised society, which makes the existence of Boko Haram possible based on particular local conditions.
 

In this frame, Nigeria is presented as a geographically unfortunate victim of the presence of such a group as Boko Haram. Delivering the 2014 Robert Sobukwe Lecture, Pumla Dineo Gqola argued that the danger of reducing Boko Haram to ""their fundamentalist Muslim identity"" is that we ""turn away from the kinds of slaughter Africans subject one another to. We deal with them one at a time, imagining we can bring our girls home without facing the reality of what Boko Haram is, of how and why it exists."" Daniel Agbiboa and Benjamin Maiangwa in their paper, ""Nigeria united in grief; divided in response: religious terrorism, Boko Haram, and the dynamics of state response"", published in the African Journal on Conflict Resolution (2014), point to the brutality with which the government's special Joint Military Task Force (JTF), composed of 8 000 soldiers, has approached its fight against Boko Haram. The authors point out the JTF has been accused of ""killing innocent people in the name of countering terrorism in northern Nigeria"". This includes soldiers setting ""fire to houses, shops, and cars, randomly arresting men from the neighbourhood, and in some cases executing them in front of their shops or houses"". They conclude that these violent attacks by Boko Haram and what some authors have called the ""Government Haram"" evidenced by the ""excessive use of force by the JTF and inter-communal violence in northern Nigeria is creating a deadly cocktail that puts populations at heightened risk of crimes against humanity in Nigeria"". In July it was reported that 11 of the parents of the Chibok girls have died. Some died due to heart failure, high blood pressure and other stress related illnesses due to the despair of losing their children. October was the six-month anniversary of the abduction of the girls. So many months later, the town of Chibok has been cut from the rest of the country, flights have been halted and the roads are stained with burnt vehicles. Reports of further kidnappings more recently in Yobe tell us that Boko Haram is determined to gain control of more areas. In these cases it is easy to conclude that the global attention on the abducted girls has yielded no results. The real danger, however, will be for the international community to stop asking questions about the rescue of these girls. Boko Haram has demonstrated the limited vocabulary with which to understand its claims. They seemingly will not be disappearing, as their forms of attack are getting even more sophisticated to alert us to the reality that attacks will go beyond those in the north-east of Nigeria. We are challenged to do the difficult work of understanding the intricate local dimensions that lead to the emergence of such groups. In doing so, we may need to first locate Boko Haram within larger questions of militarism beyond the narrow language of the war on terror. The benefit of the political posturing that accompanies the national elections of 2015 in Nigeria is that it will force an inward looking conversation about the presence of Boko Haram. Such as why and how it was possible that for the organisation to successfully carry out its largest ever abduction in April by using the bodies of young girls as weapons of war. It is up to us, Africans and the international community, to pay attention to these conversations so as to improve our solidarity efforts towards the families and communities of the young girls whose lives have been sacrificed for political ends.

28 October 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"28 October 2014 15:04 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2014 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Oct 28, 2014 (The Guardian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- FOREIGN Affairs Minister, Aminu Wali, assured yesterday that the various attacks and reported abductions in the North East despite the ceasefire agreement would not threaten the ongoing negotiations between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram as being facilitated by the Chadian President, Gen. Idriss Gaby.
Meanwhile, Germany and France have pledged to support Nigeria's fight against Boko Haram, the perfection of Ebola eradication, the ceasefire deal, freedom for the abducted Chibok schoolgirls, and the 2015 general elections.
They also believe that a credible 2015 election will tremendously defend and project the image of Nigeria particularly and whole of Africa. This was their position when they led a delegation on a courtesy visit to the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Attahiru Jega, in Abuja yesterday.
Responding, Jega said the commission was working closely with all key stakeholders to address the challenges that have to end before the elections. According to him, ""one of the challenges is security and how it could affect the conduct of the elections.
""From our interaction, we are working with security agencies. We know that these challenges are there; our hope and prayer is that before the 2015 general elections, tremendous success would have been attained to ensure that elections are peaceful and credible throughout Nigeria.""
Jega said the commission was taking its responsibilities of contributing towards deepening democracy in the country with all the seriousness it deserves and promised to deliver credible elections coming year.
Nevertheless, President Goodluck Jonathan said he expects and hopes that Nigerians would no longer suffer discriminatory checks and stigmatisation outside the country with the recent clean bill of health from the Ebola virus.
Speaking at an audience with the Foreign Ministers of Germany and France at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, Jonathan restated the Federal Government's displeasure at the stigmatization of Nigerians by some countries since the virus entered the country on July 20 through a Liberian traveller.
He maintained that there was never any justifiable basis for the stigmatization since the virus was rapidly contained in the country and never attained epidemic level. He assured that Nigeria would remain vigilant to prevent its re-entry into the country because the government recognizes that the country would remain at risk as long as the virus is active in other West African countries or other parts of the world.
To that end, he said, Nigeria would cooperate fully with other concerned nations to stop its spread in West Africa as quickly as possible. The ministers had said they were in Nigeria to seek further cooperation with the Federal Government in the growing global effort to contain the Ebola outbreak and continued spread.
Acknowledging that the challenge is tremendous, Fabius, however, reminded the electoral umpire: ""You have great responsibility towards Nigeria. The image of Nigeria is at stake and the image of Africa as well.""
According to Fabius, the delegation visited the commission because of its responsibility to conduct credible elections in 2015. He stated: ""We congratulate your institution for the way you handled general elections in 2011 and more recently the current elections.
""We have no doubt that this election will be free, fair and transparent. The European Union (EU) will contribute to it financially and will also dispatch EU observation mission.""
 

The delegation, he said, was interested in knowing INEC's preparation for the security challenges because of the current situation, particularly in the northern part of Nigeria. He added: ""We are here to tell you that we have great confidence in what you are going and what you will do."" For Seinmeier, Nigeria should increase efforts at ending insurgency ahead of the 2015 elections because, ""the elections you are preparing for are taking place under difficult conditions, fighting two enemies at a time Ebola and Boko Haram and its terrorist groups. Wali spoke yesterday when the French Foreign Minister, Mr. Laurent Fabius, and his German counterpart, Dr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who are in Nigeria for a trilateral meeting, assured Nigeria of their support against terrorism and Ebola scourge. According to Wali, ""the negotiations going on are too delicate to make any pronouncement on until we are sure of what we are able to achieve in the process. The Chibok girls are part of the discussions and negotiations and I want to thank the President of Chad for facilitating the whole process. ""The abduction of more girls is something that has been going on for sometime now and the statement issued by one of the Boko Haram people said they were done by some other dissident groups and criminals, not Boko Haram. This is something that definitely has been going on for sometime now. ""We also suspect that there may be some dissidents of the main Boko Haram body creating problems in order to break the ceasefire, but certainly this is not something that will threaten the ceasefire negotiations going on. We will also make effort to bring those into the negotiations."" However, Fabius said: ""This is the first time we are travelling together to Nigeria because of its importance, French and Germany working together is like the whole Europe. We are here to express our commitment to fighting terrorism, against Boko Haram, which is not for Nigeria only but the whole African region, and the efforts to free the girls, and Ebola.","Ceasefire Deal Stays Despite Attacks, Says Govt

A ceasefire with the Boko Haram has been negotiated. Never mind that there are still skirmishes here and there. ""Clueless"" Goodluck Jonathan has forced the insurgents to consider seriously putting down their arms.
He has done this in spite of the nagging of the opposition about his ""cluelessness."" He has done this through the much-maligned Nigerian military; and without mortgaging the nation's security to foreign troops. Now is the time to give the microphone to Lai Mohammed, who talks about Nigeria's security as if he were a Chadian. Now is the time to hear from Muhammadu Buhari, who claimed in the past that Boko Haram is a malevolent Southern conspiracy against the North.

What would these implacable critics of Goodluck Jonathan say if the girls were released now? Would they be gracious and eat their words? Don't bet on it. Don't expect them to commend the purposeful tactical manner by which the Jonathan administration has forced the Boko Haram, at the very least, to the negotiating table. It is increasingly apparent that if Jonathan is ""clueless,"" his ""cluelessness"" is the magic that Nigeria needs at this very moment in time.
On hearing that a ceasefire had been negotiated and that the girls might be released, Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso still had this to say: ""What we need to do is to take appropriate military step to stop insurgents and protect the territorial integrity of Nigeria or we sit down and negotiate with the insurgents."" Now that is what is called new original thinking. Clearly, Kwankwaso has nothing worthwhile to contribute to this matter but hot air.
Politicising Chibok
Only in Nigeria does a national tragedy get so mischievously politicized, just because of the rampaging ambitions of a power-hungry cabal. In the face of insurgencies, nations close ranks. No British government was ever pilloried for the terrorist activities of the IRA. However, in Nigeria, the leaders of a roguish opposition party accuse the government of complicity in the insurgency. They undermine the resolve of the military. Then they maintain that the government is incapable of dealing with the situation.
The fact is that in Nigeria, the APC opposition is fundamentally unpatriotic. It is not averse to play political football with Nigeria's security. It has yet been able to tell Nigerians what it would do differently from the government to achieve more immediate results. Would it carpet-bomb Sambisa forest and bring home the dead bodies of the girls? Would it use black magic to pinpoint their precise locations? Or would it send the loquacious Lai Mohammed into the hideouts of the Boko Haram as Nigeria's distinguished Ambassador?
All the opposition has offered to date is a load of sound and fury designed to divide the North from the government. Now that this is backfiring, let us hear what the acerbic Northern Elders Forum and the wolf-crying Arewa Consultative Forum have to say. They said they would not accept the re-election of Goodluck Jonathan unless the girls were released. Would they campaign for the president if the girls were now to be released?
There was never a magic wand to the release of the girls. But you would not think so if you were to listen to these ethnic jingoists. These people forget that it was the same ""clueless"" Goodluck Jonathan who midwifed
 

a durable peace with the militants of the Niger Delta. They were hoping to seize power by cloak-and-dagger means under a democratic dispensation, threatening to soak the dogs and the baboons in blood unless they have their way.
Promoting democracy
There is something anomalous about having military dictators take off their uniforms and then masquerade as democrats. We had this charade with Obasanjo. Whatever anybody might call our dear former president, he was anything but a democrat. Every election conducted under his watch was massively rigged and highly disputed.
Can anybody imagine what would have happened if Obasanjo was labeled as ""clueless"" during his presidency? How quickly they forget. By the time some offending journalists disappear, nobody would have dared any longer. Have we forgotten the rash of political assassinations under Obasanjo? Even the country's Attorney General was not spared.
But now we have the government of Goodluck Jonathan. The opposition is calling him ""clueless"" and no one gets arrested. No one gets shot. Jonathan continues to smile. Under him, the press is free and unfettered. Finally, Jonathan has signed a Freedom of Information bill into law. This has made the Nigerian press one of the freest in the world. It validates the right of Nigerians to information about how they are being governed and safeguards our freedom of expression. Why was this legislation not passed until Jonathan came into power? The answer is simple. Jonathan is the first real democrat to rule Nigeria.
Nigerians need to remember this before we surrender our freedoms to another military turncoat masquerading as a democrat in the person of Muhammadu Buhari. Nobody who knows Buhari would accuse him of being a democrat; no matter the convenient noises he is making now. Lest we forget: Buhari overthrew a democratic government; jailed ministers without trial; muzzled the press; killed innocent Nigerians under retroactive decrees. Surely we cannot allow this military man in civilian clothing to violate our freedoms yet again.
""Clueless"" Jonathan has supervised truly democratic elections. Despite the noises made by people like Lai Mohammed, who are paid to make negative noises, Jonathan has not rigged any polls to prevent the opposition from prevailing where they have genuine support on the ground. As a matter of fact, it is on record that opposition parties have won more elections under Jonathan than under all previous dispensations put together. This can be attributed to the democratic inclination of the president, and he has erased the do-or-die politics of the past.
From Edo, to Ondo, to Anambra, to Ekiti, to Osun, the Jonathan administration has overseen free and fair democratic elections, devoid of acrimony and violence. In Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, Jonathan declared a state of emergency to quell the Boko Haram insurgency. Nevertheless, unlike Obasanjo, he was mindful of the prevailing democratic structures and did not tamper with them.
Ebola-free Nigeria
While the power-hungry opposition is determined to blame Jonathan for every negative national happenstance, even including car accidents on federal roads; it is equally determined to deny him of plaudits for successes under his watch. The deadly and highly contagious Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) came into Nigeria by way of Liberia, claiming precious lives. The government swung into action, mobilized resources and organised a resistance that contained the epidemic in record time. Thanks to this forthrightness, the whole country now breathes a sigh of relief.
Three months down the road, the World Health Organisation has now declared Nigeria Ebola-free. It did not declare Lagos State Ebola-free. It did not declare Rivers State Ebola-free. It declared Nigeria Ebola-free. The president of Nigeria is Goodluck Jonathan. It is not Babatunde Fashola. It is not Rotimi Amaechi. And yet these two APC state governors are claiming that Nigeria's victory over Ebola is due to them. This is poppycock! The victory belongs to Goodluck Jonathan who is the only man charged with the responsibility for what happens in Nigeria. The buck starts and ends with our president.
Even former president Olusegun Obasanjo, an implacable opponent of Goodluck Jonathan, could not help but commend the Jonathan administration for the way and manner it moved with speed and determination, and kept the Ebola virus at bay. Should the epidemic return to ravage Nigeria (God forbid), Jonathan would be held responsible. Now that we have prevailed over the scourge, Jonathan deserves all the praise. Indeed, Western governments are now sending people to Nigeria to study how we dealt with Ebola.
Goodluck factor
The truth of the matter is that there is something compelling about this South-South man from Otuoke in Bayelsa State. This accounts for his very mysterious rise to the presidency. Under his stewardship, Nigeria
 

has attained milestones that have eluded us in the past. With four more years of Goodluck Jonathan in the presidential saddle, we are bound to achieve even more. Without wanting to sound too fatalistic, it is undeniable that Goodluck Jonathan brings good fortune to Nigeria. Under Jonathan's presidency, Nigeria's Under-17 football team won an unprecedented fourth World Cup title in 2013, making Nigeria the most successful country in the tournament's history. We also won the African Cup of Nations football tournament in 2013; the first time since 1994. No government in the history of Nigeria has ever had this combination of accolades. At the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014, we won 11 gold, 11 silver and 14 bronze medals, to place eighth overall. That is something of a record. We also won four medals at the World Athletic Championship; the last time we won a medal there was in 2000. This Goodluck factor also extends to international relations. In 2010, Nigeria was elected into the United Nations Security Council as a non-permanent, non-veto member for the 2011-2012 sessions. In a most amazing manner, we were re-elected again in 2013 for the 2014-15 sessions. This is unprecedented in the annals of Nigeria. The UNSC is the most important and prestigious organ of the U.N. Nigeria has only served on the UNSC on three previous occasions. Four more years I am not from the South-South. I don't know Goodluck Jonathan from Adam, and I don't want to know him. I will never accept a government job. But I am a Nigerian, and I feel affronted when I see all these power-mongers bad-mouthing our president, simply because he is from the minority South-South and they want power at all cost. There can be no question that Goodluck Jonathan has been an effective president, and he should be allowed to continue for another four years. Two terms of South-South presidency is surely not excessive appreciation for our chronic reliance on South-South oil.","What Exactly Is 'Clueless' About Goodluck Jonathan? (3)

Oct 27, 2014 (This Day/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- I have been listening to comments and reading analyses on the 2015 presidential election with rapt attention. There is nothing unanimous in the predictions and projections, but I am sensing a trend in the analyses: that if the All Progressives Congress (APC) fields Maj. General Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) against President Goodluck Jonathan of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), then it will be a piece of cake for the former head of state. A Buhari supporter, in a recent newspaper interview, said Buhari's votes in the North plus Bola Tinubu's votes in the south-west equal automatic victory for APC.
Slow down a bit, guys. I have no intention of raining on anyone's parade or pouring cold water on exciting calculations, but analyses do not have to be this simplistic. If the history and politics of elections in Nigeria are to be of any use in these postulations, the safest bet will be to say there are still many rivers to cross. My intention today is to draw attention to several facts and factors that will be at play during the elections. Many things are still taking shape; opportunities and threats still exist for the PDP and the APC. It is too early in the day to arrive at definite conclusions.
Let us look into some of the assumptions one by one. The first is that Buhari will clear the votes in the core North and Tinubu will deliver the South-west votes in one basket. That Buhari will win in the core North has never been in dispute a""EUR he has done so consistently since 2003. It is unthinkable that he will not win there. However, I'm not sure Tinubu can clear the South-west the same way Buhari could do in the core North. It appears many commentators have not been monitoring recent developments in the South-west. To start with, two of the six states a""EUR Ekiti and Ondo a""EUR are now in the hands of PDP. That is important to note.
Meanwhile, the APC is getting weaker in Oyo state. The three APC senators have left the party; the death of Alhaji Alao Arisekola has dealt some body blow on Governor Abiola Ajimobi; former Governor Adebayo Alao-Akala (PDP) is on a rebound; former Governor Rashidi Ladoja, who controls large portions of Ibadan, is complicating things for APC. In Ogun, Governor Ibikunle Amosun is under fire from within and without. Chief Olusegun Osoba, in whose camp the Ogun APC senators and house members are, is playing hard ball with Amosun. The PDP, meanwhile, is bringing back its break-up groups and rebuilding in the state.
In simple words, Oyo and Ogun have become very shaky and it is a bit tenuous to assume the South-west will vote en bloc for APC in 2015. I may well be wrong, but I am seeing a split of the zone's 13.5 million votes. The South-west, in my opinion, is neither here nor there yet. No assumptions should be made and no conclusions should be reached yet, certainly not in October 2014. Of course, the APC is not sleeping and is also hoping to gain from the fall-outs from PDP's possible slips in the coming weeks. But South-west does not look like one-way traffic as at today.
Meanwhile, there is also this assumption that Buhari a""EUR or APC a""EUR does not need the South-east and South-south (SESS). That is ridiculous. First, it is not good for Buhari's CV that he has never won in any Southern state since he launched his presidential bid in 2003. Not one state. And it is also not good political strategy to downplay SESS. There are 11 states in these two geo-political zones. The APC calculation may be that the South-south would rather have a ""son of the soil"" as president. The South-east, it seems, is fully joined in matrimony to South-south under Jonathan's presidency. But does that mean giving up without a fight?
Let us now reverse the case. Jonathan, despite knowing that the core North will be a difficult hunting ground for him, is putting up a decent fight. He is working to secure as many votes as possible in Buhari's territory. The president has gathered many strong politicians to his side. Now let us do some basic calculations. SESS has 17 million votes combined. Buhari's home zone, North-west, has 18.7 million registered voters. If Jonathan bites off as much as 30-40% of the votes in the North-west (which he did in 2011) while Buhari does poorly in SESS (like before), Jonathan would clearly gain more than Buhari in the candidates' home zones.
 

Jonathan's chances, in the meantime, are also bright among the Northern minorities. It could be minority solidarity, I can't say. The North-central has 11 million names on the voter register. Jonathan's reconciliation with former military, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, and the governor of Niger State, Dr. Babangida Aliyu, could help him in Niger state. Kogi, Plateau, Nasarawa and Benue would ordinarily back Jonathan. But Kwara, which supported him in 2011, is now uncertain, with the godfather, Bukola Saraki, relocating to APC. Buhari will fancy his chances in Kwara, that is if Saraki can ward off his PDP foes, who look very formidable. In truth, Kwara now looks more like a tight corner for both parties.
The North-east, boasting of 11 million registered voters, could be a mixed bag. Gombe, Bauchi, Yobe and Borno have always gone to Buhari, while Taraba and Adamawa seem to have a thing for Jonathan. But something significant has changed in Borno: Ali Modu Sheriff is now in PDP. Since 1999, Borno has always faced any direction Sheriff pointed to, and his defection must be considered a loss to APC. I was not surprised at APC's reaction when Sheriff left: Borno's 2.5 million votes are the nation's fifth largest after Lagos (5.4m), Kano (4.7m), Kaduna (3.7m) and Katsina (2.9m). Being Buhari's familiar hunting ground, however, Borno could still be game for him.
Before I shut down my computer, I would like to maintain that unlike many observers and analysts, I foresee a very competitive election. And, I think, four months to the polls, we should avoid jumping into certain conclusions. One of the major failings of the opposition is that they underrated Jonathan's ability to respond to the momentum they gained last year. Before they could settle down to savour the heavyweight defections from PDP to APC, the Jonathan camp had launched a counter offensive, in addition to benefitting from crises arising from the consolidation process of APC.
Therefore, dear readers, with what I have seen in Nigeria in the last few months, and what I understand about the dynamics of our electoral politics, I would conclude that the day is still young. For the two leading parties, there are still many hurdles to clear. Let the game begin!
And Four Other Things...
EBOLA-FREE INDEED The World Health Organisation (WHO) has certified Nigeria Ebola-free and this is fantastic news. But so were we before Patrick Sawyer sneaked in from Liberia with the agent of death. It takes just one case to get us back in it, so vigilance is key. A two-year-old Guinean girl has just infected Mali, having been taken by road transport abroad after the death of her mother from Ebola. I think we're doing well checking body temperatures at the airports, but for as long as we maintain road links with the rest of West Africa, we remain at high risk. Caution.
CEASEFIRE BY FORCE With the state of my mind now, I don't want to hear anything but ceasefire in the North-east a""EUR and the release of the Chibok girls. Claims that the Nigerian government is holding talks with genuine representatives of Boko Haram had better be true. The continuous attacks on Borno villages and the fresh abduction of 60 women and girls are so depressing that any form of positive news is welcome at this time. I eagerly await the sect's ""promise"" to release the girls again this week. It just has to be true. Hope deferred maketh the heart sick. Anxiety.
BBOG AND APC A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Audu Ogbeh, recently spoke of his party's political links with the Bring Back Our Girls movement. ""We commend the Bring Back Our Girls movement led by members of our party for their commitment,"" he said. To supporters of President Goodluck Jonathan, this was the final confirmation of their allegation all the while that BBOG was an APC political gathering. Ogbeh clearly committed a Freudian slip, but we should not allow that to becloud the fact that BBOG is a worthy cause. I think we should just keep politics out of this traumatic experience. Decency.
GOWON AT 80 I am always happy when someone is making the 70th birthday and beyond. That is a sign of long life in this age of all kinds of illnesses and diseases killing people. I therefore celebrate with former head of state, General Yakubu Gowon, on his 80th birthday. I was expecting a birthday present to Nigerians from Gowon a""EUR his memoirs on the Nigerian civil war a""EUR but we may have to wait in vain. Dim Emeka Ojukwu died with his memoirs unwritten, denying us a first-hand account of his experience. Gowon is following the same path.

The top headline reads ""Nene Administers Tough Love"", with the BusinessDay editorial warning that Minister Nene is not set to be Mr Popular.
Tough measures in yesterday's mini-budget include tax increases, job freezes and across-the-board budget cuts to deal with low economic growth, high debt levels and lower than expected tax income.
It is likely, according to BusinessDay's analysis, that key government ally, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, will baulk at proposals to sell-off state assets to private investors, and they won't like the imposition of caps on public-sector employment and pay scales. Similarly, there are some in the private sector who will be unhappy at the prospect of tax increases to help plug the budget deficit.
However, concludes the financial daily, the likelihood that nobody will be entirely happy with the taste of the medicine Nene intends dispensing could well be the strength of his approach.
Sister paper The Star reports that South Africa's deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa arrived in Maseru, Lesotho, yesterday to continue facilitate the country's return to political normalcy.
Ramaphosa was expected to meet various political role players, and pay a visit to His Majesty King Letsie III. The king reconvened Lesotho's parliament last Friday. Elections are due to be held in February
Community leaders in north-east Nigeria have questioned official claims of a ceasefire with Boko Haram militants.
Persistent violence in the region has undermined government claims to have negotiated an end of hostilities with the Islamist militant group.
A lack of detail about the agreement the Nigerian military announced last Friday, and complaints of exclusion from the process by community leaders in the worst-hit areas, are fuelling scepticism about prospects of an end to the five-year rebellion.
As part of the ceasefire announcement, Nigerian authorities said the Islamist militant group had indicated its willingness to discuss the release of more than 200 schoolgirls it abducted from the town of Chibok in April.
Punch and the Daily Trust both report this morning that a further sixty women have reportedly been abducted by suspected members of Boko Haram at Waga Mangoro and Garta villages, both in Adamawa State. The abductions are said to have taken place last Saturday.
In Kenya, ruling Jubilee coalition MPs have launched a fresh attack on the International Criminal Court after judges reprimanded the Kenya government for allegedly leaking confidential information related to President Uhuru Kenyatta's case.
The president is being tried for alleged crimes against humanity.
Close to 50 MPs allied to the ruling coalition accused the ICC of making the ruling to set the stage for a finding of non-compliance against Kenya and advance what they claim is a political conspiracy against President Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto's Jubilee government.
 

ICC judges are trying to decide whether the Kenyan government is guilty of obstructing investigations by the prosecution in the case against the Head of State. This after prosecutors claimed they were unable to secure records of Uhuru's bank accounts and telephone conversations. Uhuru's lawyers have called for the termination of the case for lack of evidence. According to Ugandan paper, New Vision, the authorities in Rwanda boosted travel restrictions yesterday to stem the spread of the Ebola virus, ordering travellers who have been in the United States and Spain to send daily updates on their health status. The requirement applies to all travellers who have been in the US or Spain within the past three weeks. Phone or text messages must be sent every day for the first 21 days they remain in Rwanda. Visitors who have been to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone within the last three weeks are barred from entry to Rwanda. Nationals returning from those countries are quarantined. Ebola has claimed more than 4,500 lives in west Africa, and experts warn the rate of infection could reach 10,000 a week by early December.","African Press Review 23 October 2014

The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Aminu Wali, speaking at the second plenary session of the Nigeria German Bi-National Commission, which closed in Berlin Tuesday, appealed to Germany and countries of the European Union to join the fight against EVD. He added that since Nigeria has been certified free of EVD, there was therefore no basis for any form of discrimination or stigmatisation against Nigerians travelling all over the world. ""I call on our development partners to increase support to current efforts at controlling EVD as well as to see that it is contained in the West Africa sub-region. Nigeria has donated the sum of $3.5million towards this effort and would be happy to have Germany and our EU partners come on board,"" Wali said. He also spoke on the Boko Haram issue, noting that the efforts of the Nigerian armed forces and development partners would ensure that soon, normalcy return to North-eastern part of Nigeria. The results of joint efforts, he said, had seen to the recent ceasefire deal reached between the government and the terrorist group. ""In spite of the aforementioned challenges, Nigeria's economy is open for investments to the German private sector in the spectrum of sectors such as power, oil and gas, agriculture, infrastructure, among others,"" the Minister said. He disclosed that all draft agreements and Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) are being revisited, in order to accelerate action on cooperation between both nations.

Oct 22, 2014 (This Day/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- In this in-depth interview, Charles Aniagolu, an Arise Television anchor, sat down with one of the government officials leading negotiations with the terrorist group Boko Haram and Principal Secretary to the President, Ambassador Hassan Tukur, on how the ceasefire was struck and continuing negotiations with the sect to secure the release of over 200 Chibok schoolgirls and bring an end to hostilities in the North-east. Excerpts:
When did the federal government open talks with Boko Haram?
We have been discussing with the Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Hidda' Awati Wal-Jihad (Boko Haram) as you mentioned since 2013. The federal government has been discussing with them and recently, we sat down in N'Djamena in Chad. We discussed with them under the mediation of President Idriss Deby of Chad and we agreed on a number of things. One of the things agreed on is that there should be a ceasefire between the organisation known as the Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Hidda' Awati Wal-Jihad and the Federal Government of Nigeria.
So you can unequivocally tell us that a ceasefire has been agreed with the group that everybody knows as Boko Haram? Yes.
Now put some flesh on the development for us. What are the elements of it?
When we sat down to discuss with the group, the background to it is that the organisation itself through its own network contacted the government of Chad that it would want to see a meaningful dialogue between the organisation and the federal government to see that we bring this insurgency to an end.
(Interjects): They contacted you?
They contacted the government of Chad through a letter. Chad took some time to verify their sources, to verify whether the initiative is from the actual group known as Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Hidda' Awati Wal-Jihad, which is known by every other person as Boko Haram. They did their verification. Following this verification, they now contacted the Nigerian government to see if we could sit down to dialogue with this organisation so that we can end this insurgency. Following that, we sat down and discussed with them and agreed that it is better to sit down and resolve this crisis.
But why now, because there have been several attempts in the past to negotiate with them?
You as a Nigerian know that Nigeria is a major country in Africa and globally. We have played a role in many countries; we have brought peace to many countries around the world -- Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cote d' Ivoire. We were part of the peace-keeping forces seven days after the independence in Congo. So if a country like Nigeria is under this kind of crisis and people are dying, no government will sit down and fold its arms and President Goodluck Jonathan has said it time and again that he will take every measure to make sure that this insurgency is brought to an end. He did not preclude anything, including dialogue, including mediation which you know very well that he set up a tracking committee about one-and-a-half years ago under the Minister of Special Duties. The committee went round, went to the prisons, discussed with members of the insurgency that are in our prisons; the Ulamas, that is the Islamic clerics that taught these people that are in this organisation; discussed with traditional rulers across the country; governors, anybody that matters, anybody that can assist the government bring this crisis to an end. The tracking committee went round and discussed with them. So, this is a continuation of the federal government's effort to see that we bring this insurgency to an end. And if it is taking place in N'Djamena or any part of the world, it does not matter as long as we sit down and address this insurgency, and address these issues and bring this crisis to an end.
But of course the curiosity is that you have made attempts in the past and after purported negotiations such as this one, they have come out to robustly deny that they reached any agreement with you. I mean what did you have to give up to them? If you get the background to this, they did the announcement first. They
 

announced on Thursday at about 9.30pm that they had ceased fire. Now during the discussion, the agreement is that the federal government and the Chadian government said look, we cannot continue discussing and we cannot discuss all the issues that you (Boko Haram) put on the table unless there is a cessation of hostilities. This is item number one. Cease hostilities and then we will sit down and look at every issue.
So what were the items they were putting on the table?
I cannot pre-empt these items because the items will come. Now we have achieved the cessation of hostilities.
Did you have to do anything to get them to agree to the cessation of hostilities?
Did you offer them anything? We did not offer them anything but we gave them the confidence that whatever they bring to the table eventually the federal government is favourably disposed to look at the whole problem, so that it would be addressed.
As you know, the world had been watching and waiting for the release of those Chibok girls. What I need to understand is that apparently, what we have heard, and you can confirm this for us, is that part of the package in that agreement is that they are supposed to release the Chibok girls. Can you confirm that that is going to happen? Now if you listen to their own spokesperson, Danladi Ahmahdu, who indicated that they have declared a ceasefire between them and the federal government, in the same broadcast that he gave to the VOA, he indicated that the Chibok girls would be released eventually. They promised to release the Chibok girls.
When you say eventually... what we are trying to determine is when they are going to be released. We understand they are going to be released on Monday. Can you confirm that?
No, I cannot confirm that they are going to be released on Monday because the understanding we reached is that this is a continuous dialogue. First of all, we have agreed that there will be a ceasefire. They have announced the ceasefire. During the discussion we had in Chad, they promised and said they will release the Chinese and the wife of the Camerounian deputy prime minister and a traditional ruler and they have done that. After that, they said we will meet next week. So I think we should wait and see the outcome of our meeting next week. It is not good to pre-empt anything.
Do we have any timetable for the release of the girls?
That will be determined when we meet next.
When are you meeting next?
Next week, hopefully. I am as hopeful as you are.
When next week?
I can't tell you when, but hopefully we are going to meet next week
Now can you confirm based on your discussions with the representative of Boko Haram that the Chibok girls are alive and well?
We are sure that they are alive and well.
There are also dozens of other women and other Nigerian's who are held by Boko Haram, what happens to them?
This is why I said we are having a global approach to solving the insurgency. These are all issues that will eventually be addressed when we sit down with them hopefully in the next one week or so.
As you can imagine, there is a lot of scepticism in Nigeria around this purported agreement, many people are saying it is simply too good to be true. What would you say to those people?
Well, there are many people who are sceptics and there are many people who, whatever the government does, they do not believe in it. Because they think the government has not done much or the government is not doing enough. But honestly, I have cautious optimism that this thing is going to succeed. What I will tell Nigerians is to give government a chance and support the government and allow the government and the Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Hidda' Awati Wal-Jihad to come to a conclusive and positive agreement. It is not good to be a sceptic, not to doubt anything and what gives me hope at this time is that I have a feeling that the people that they sent to discuss with us are serious minded people. They are people who are close the leadership of the Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Hidda' Awati Wal-Jihad. I think they are the right hand men of Imam  

Shekau. So, from their body language and what we have discussed, I'm positive that we are going to succeed. Because in the past, when you are discussing with somebody, he tells you I am going to declare a ceasefire on so and so time and at so and so hour and he does it. He tells you I am going to release the Chinese and other people in our custody and they do that. You have to give him an opportunity and continue discussing. I don't think there is any need for pessimism and being sceptical about the whole issue. People should be positive. I for one, I am positive and I can tell you the government is positive. The government will do whatever it takes to bring this insurgency to an end, because it is taking a toll on our country. People are dying on a daily basis. The economy of the North is being destroyed. I am from that area. Maybe some of the people that are sceptical are not from the area. If you are from the area, it will cause you pain. The president has said it time and again, if one Nigerian dies or a member of the Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Hidda' Awati Wal-Jihad dies or a foreigner dies or a military man or police, it causes him great pain. And you understand that for those of us in government, it gives us an extra burden of responsibility to make sure that whatever is possible is done to make sure that this insurgency comes to an end. Now the opposition party says that this is timed to give President Jonathan considerable political advantage ahead of his possible declaration that he is going to run for the presidential election in 2015. Should President Jonathan share in the success of this agreement? Is any of it due to his contribution? I do not want to go into politics. I do not want to go into declaration or what the opposition has said. But what I can tell you is that nobody should politicise this insurgency. Maybe some of the people in politics either in the opposition do not understand the magnitude of the crisis we have faced with this insurgency. If they are from these areas, they will know how devastated these areas are. Borno State, Yobe State and parts of Adamawa State are devastated. And Nigeria as a key country in the continent, if you are under this assault, you should not politicise it. The government is not politicising it. Declaration or not, it is a timetable, 2015 elections have to take place on February 15.",Tukur - Boko Haram Has Promised to Release Chibok Girls [interview],All Africa AFNWS English 
20 October 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"20 October 2014 17:58 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2014 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved
Oct 20, 2014 (This Day/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili, former minister of education and a leading figure in the Bring Back Our Girls movement, called me on Friday afternoon, clearly desperate to hear some good news about the Chibok schoolgirls. She had heard that the girls, kidnapped by Boko Haram since April, were about to be released under a ceasefire agreement between the government and the insurgents. Immediately I saw her call, I knew what it was about.
""Simon, is it true?"" she asked, and for one second you would think I actually held the key to the truth. ""Well, the chief of defence staff himself addressed the media to announce it, so it must be true,"" I said, authoritatively. ""But we have heard all this before, Simon, haven't we? How do we know it is true this time around? Will these girls return?"" she said. By now, her voice was cracking, and I sensed she had broken down in tears.
I, too, was getting emotional. Earlier in the day, I had looked at the still images of the girls from a Boko Haram video and said to myself: ""God, where are these girls? Will they ever return home? What is going on in the heads of their parents and siblings right now?""
The reported peace deal, or ceasefire agreement, means different things to Nigerians. To Ezekwesili, it is an opportunity to see the safe return of the teenagers who are thought to be 219 in all. Anything that would bring them back alive is welcome. To many, this is the beginning of a negotiated end to the insurgency and other evils associated with it. They think that for the insurgents, or some of them, to be ready to dialogue at all is a good sign. To the soldiers on the warfront and their families, this could be a big relief after so many deaths on the battlefield.
In some circles, however, a ceasefire represents the ultimate surrender of the Nigerian state to terrorism, a huge dent on national ego and a sign of how weak the Nigerian government has become. To the military hierarchy, this may be viewed as a humiliation, for how can we be discussing with terrorists who deserve nothing but death after all the horror they have inflicted on soldiers and civilians? I also heard several comments that President Goodluck Jonathan agreed to the peace deal because he is desperate to be returned to office next year. We all have our opinions, of course.
My opinion on this, which I started expressing in the last four years, is that we cannot defeat Boko Haram with military force alone. In a series of articles that I did on the insurgency, I camped with those who wanted government to engage in dialogue, offer amnesty to those who are ready to defect from Boko Haram, and engage those who refuse to surrender in military action. To be honest, I was only being realistic.
We were fighting a war that we were ill-prepared for, further complicated by its unconventional nature. That the insurgents probably enjoyed sympathy from some security, political and religious leaders also made it difficult for Nigeria. This is to say nothing about the state of the Nigerian armed forces, the difficult terrain in the north-east and the vulnerability of several towns and villages to the insurgency. I clearly favoured a negotiated end to the militancy. There is certainly a downside to negotiation a""EUR it could offer a perverse incentive for many groups to spring up, but the secret would be to improve our security capacity to nip such things in the bud.
My viewpoint, first expressed in 2011, was rejected by many readers. Some said I was out of my mind; many said I was playing to the gallery; several others said I was trying to be politically correct. A reader accused me of always pandering to ""these Northerners"". Another reader warned me not to compare Niger Delta militants to Boko Haram. ""The militants only killed soldiers. Boko Haram terrorists are killing civilians,"" a reader wrote in an email. The consensus among those who opposed my view was: we must deploy military action to crush Boko Haram.
Fellow Nigerians, between the time I wrote that article and today, the militants have gone from hit-and-run attacks, in form of bombings, to putting boots on the ground, capturing towns and villages and hoisting their
 

flags and proclaiming a caliphate. They have killed an emir. They have killed thousands. They have bombed churches and mosques. They have killed hundreds of soldiers. They have kidnapped schoolgirls and women. They have destroyed whole villages. They have acquired surface-to-air missiles. They have brought down a fighter jet. Imagine if we had pursued a peace deal years ago. Imagine the calamity we could have saved this nation.
For those who are still opposed to a peace deal, maybe they need to project into the next three years. It is either of two things a""EUR we successfully wipe out the terrorists and there will be peace forever, or the insurgency grows worse and we lose the whole of Borno and Yobe states to Boko Haram. Have opponents of a peace deal ever wondered why the more we say we have killed the terrorists, the more they come at us? As I write this, many Borno villages and towns are still under Boko Haram. If military action was that easy, we would not be here discussing ceasefire.
If indeed we are able to reach a ceasefire, it will offer us a great opportunity to develop a comprehensive plan to secure our territory. We need to re-appraise our current approach, retool the military, re-organise our border patrol mechanism and generally improve the capacity of the state to tackle insurgency. Niger Delta militants and Boko Haram have proved to the world that our military capacity is highly limited, and we need to face that fact and act accordingly.
Assuming the ceasefire deal works out (some Boko Haram factions, I understand, are not a party to it), we must change tact. The National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki (rtd) has already given us a few hints. We must get ready to rehabilitate the insurgents who come forward to surrender their weapons. We must develop a counter message to the doctrine of religious hate and extremism. We must develop early warning mechanisms and legal frameworks to deal with preachers and religious leaders who incite their followers to murder. Ultimately, though, President Jonathan must fast-track his intervention programmes to deliver skills and livelihoods to millions of unemployed youths.
Those who oppose ceasefire, dialogue, peace deal and amnesty need to enlighten us on how we can defeat an idea with military action. The US and its allies have been bombing and bombarding the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and ISIS, but the very idea of fundamentalism remains alive and kicking. It keeps producing terror gangs in different shapes and forms. This can only show that something deeper and broader is needed to counter this ideology. To think military tanks and fighter jets alone will end terrorism is very unrealistic.
And Four Other Things...
DUBAI DEATHS When sportscaster, Aisha Falode, cried out that her son, Toba, had been murdered in Dubai earlier this year, she said it was becoming a common occurrence, but nobody listened to her. Officials at the Nigerian embassy in the United Arab Emirates even warned her to be careful with her agitations in order not to jeopardise a bilateral agreement the two countries were about to sign. Such wickedness. Now, another Nigerian has died in suspicious circumstances in Dubai. Oyamuyefa, son of former Bayelsa governor, Chief DSP Alamieyeseigha, is the latest casualty. Young Nigerians are routinely dying abroad. Co-incidence?
BUHARI VS JONATHAN With due respect to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, it is increasingly looking like the 2015 presidential election is going to be a rematch between President Goodluck Jonathan and Major-Gen. Muhammadu Buhari. Both of them squared up in 2011. They are exchanging brickbats again. Buhari, at his declaration on Wednesday, said economy was going down. Manufacturing, agriculture and power supply were ""going down"", he said. Jonathan's men have swiftly replied, citing facts and figures to counter his claims. I'm praying fervently that the presidential campaign will be healthy and will be based on issues with concrete evidence a""EUR and in good spirit. Amen.
EBOLA SCARE Guyana has placed a travel ban on Nigerians to protect its citizens from Ebola infection. Trinidad and Tobago, another Caribbean country, has followed suit. Is it right? Is it wrong? Some will argue that if Nigeria had taken a similar measure, Patrick Sawyer would not have brought Ebola to the country all the way from Liberia. Others will argue that since Nigeria was no longer having any Ebola case, and will soon be certified so, those countries should not have included us in the blacklist. Whatever, why didn't these Caribbean countries also place a travel ban on the US? Lol.
KESHI'S EXIT The sacking of Super Eagles' coach, Stephen Keshi, was a bit of a surprise to me. He looked irremovable! I've adored Keshi all my life, but he lost me with his 'resignation' after winning the Africa Cup of Nations in 2013. Again, he 'resigned' after the World Cup in Brazil and the drama continued. Keshi somehow made it look like the world revolves around him a""EUR the prima donna always reminding us that several countries are begging to hire him as their coach. What was that about?

17 October 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"17 October 2014 Fox News: On the Record w/ Greta PZAH English  2014 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. Prepared by CQ-RollCall Inc.
GRETA VAN SUSTEREN, FOX HOST: This is a FOX News alert. An Ebola scare in Washington, D.C. Today, a scare near the Pentagon. A bus packed with people quarantined when a woman got sick and falsely claimed she had been to Africa.
Also today, President Obama appointing an Ebola czar to guide the nation through giant medical crisis. But the czar, Ron Klain, is not a doctor, has no medical background. He's a lawyer and a lobbyist and a Democratic political operative. Is he the best person for the job? Is this the best President Obama can do?
The White House already under fire for handling of the Ebola response. And speaking of the administration's handling of the crisis, has the administration's Ebola response been botched right from the beginning? All the way back in March, the World Health Organization reported an Ebola outbreak in Guinea, West Africa. And then, in August, the World Health Organization declaring the epidemic to be public health emergency of international concern. What did the Obama administration do? Many say nothing or, at best, the White House is very slow to do anything.
Tonight, we have live team coverage with all the Ebola developments.
We begin in Galveston, Texas, where they're awaiting cruise ship carrying a quarantined lab worker from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. She was in a lab with Ebola samples just days before boarding the ship.
FOX News reporter, Andrea Watkins, joins us live.
Andrea, tell me what's going on with this ship and this passenger?
ANDREA WATKINS, KRIV FOX, HOUSTON: All right, Greta. Well, as far as we know, this cruise ship called ""The Magic"" from Carnival Cruise lines is going to be docking on Sunday. That's actually the scheduled docking day. But they headed home a little bit early because Cozumel refused to allow them to dock today. The cruise line said they learned late Wednesday from the CDC that there was a patient on board that had been in contact with contaminated medical waste from Dallas Presbyterian. That is where the Ebola patient, Thomas Duncan, passed away. The medical worker was self- monitoring at the time she boarded the ship on Sunday, but apparently, she didn't tell the crews line that. Now, Carnival says the woman is now quarantine on the ship, even though she hasn't shown any signs or symptoms of having Ebola. Right now, she is 19 days into that crucial 21-day incubation period. So the CDC considers her at very low risk of ever contracting the disease, but nobody is taking any chances. Belize did not allow her or her husband to get off the ship. Then the surprise this morning came when Cozumel would not even allow the ship to dock. That puts the rest of the passengers, maybe disappointed, is what you could say. They were tweeting they were stuck outside of Cozumel but Carnival is offering them $200 credit on their account and 50 percent off the next cruise line.
Whether or not things are really strained on the ship we will find out Sunday when it docks here. If the ship was over here at this port, you would be able to see it. It's a massive ship, of course. And over here, on my other shoulder, over here is UTMV, Galveston. They are the best when it comes to infectious diseases. Research and doctors here. They say that they are ready if, indeed, it's necessary to take this patient in across the street from the cruise ship port. They will take her in for observation. Right now, they haven't had to do anything medically for this patient because she is not presented with any symptoms whatsoever.
Back to you, Greta?
VAN SUSTEREN: Andrea, thank you.
 

Of course, this woman is 19 days into the 21 days, which we understand to be the cut off.
Wait until you hear this. Did you know there is a special Ebola screening machine? The military uses it in Africa. Believe it or not, the Dallas hospital at the center of the Ebola crisis has one, too. So why aren't they using it? And why didn't they use it on Mr. Duncan when he first showed up at the hospital on September 19th with Ebola-type symptoms?
Defense One tech editor, Patrick Tucker, joins us.
Nice to see you.
PATRICK TUCKER, TECH EDITOR, DEFENSE ONE: Hey, thank you.
VAN SUSTEREN: What is this machine?
TUCKER: It's called a Film Ray, from a company called BioFire. It's about toaster size. You take a sample, you stick it in there. After about an hour, it's going to tell you what you have got. It depends on what kit you arm it with. Right now, the FDA has approved the use of this machine for detecting certain types of illnesses, like listeria, types of influenza. If you want to use it to detect Ebola, you have to get a special kit for Ebola. It's like a little software pack. The thing is, though, this Dallas hospital, though they had the machine, they weren't authorized to use it to screen for Ebola because it wasn't a research-use- only machine according to the FDA guidelines.
VAN SUSTEREN: Did they have the software? I understand there are two considerations here. Whether they had the software to make it so they could test for Ebola is the first thing. Seconds thing, whether the machine was capable. And then, of course, the other is a designation. Could it have done it?
TUCKER: If they had the software. They did not. So you have to designate the machine as research-only. You call BioFire and they'll get you the software kit immediately. They are very up on this. That is just a FedEx exchange that needs to happen. They didn't have the kit. You have to change your designation in order to get it. Then once they had that, it would have taken an hour to properly diagnose.
VAN SUSTEREN: What designation did it have in this hospital?
TUCKER: Well, it's a clinical diagnostic machine. You use it --
VAN SUSTEREN: But if you say it's only for research, you could have looked for Ebola?
TUCKER: Exactly. If you tell the FDA, we're only going to use this for research, then you can use it to actually take care of parents that might have Ebola. If you want to use it to, you know, clinically diagnose listeria and not for treating Ebola patients, then it gets to retain its clinical diagnosis status.
VAN SUSTEREN: You agree that's a little nutty, the labeling of this?
TUCKER: Yeah. Exactly, ludicrous.
VAN SUSTEREN: OK, good. I thought I was the only one. It's pretty crazy.
Patrick, thank you.
The first Dallas nurse infected with Ebola, Nina Pham, is now in the D.C. area. She arrived on a specially equipped private jet last night and is now being treated at a special unit at the National Institutes of Health.
FOX News chief intelligence correspondent, Catherine Herridge, is live at NIH with the very latest -Catherine?
CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Greta. That's right. Nina Pham is being treated here at the National Institutes of Health. Before heading to Maryland, the Dallas hospital released a video where Pham thanked them for their care and they thanked her for volunteering to help Thomas Duncan, the first Ebola case to die in the U.S.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we're really proud of you.
NINA PHAM, NURSE INFECTED WITH EBOLA: (INAUDIBLE)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)  

HERRIDGE: After the three-hour flight, doctors here at the NIH, told reporters that Pham was well enough to walk off the jet and on to the ambulance. But they described the transfer as extremely taxing and draining for Pham who tonight is described to be in fair condition.
The NIH also provided this photo to reporters today of the isolation unit where Pham is being treated, while at the same time, they are gathering data to better understand the virus, whether it's mutated and the best way to treat symptoms.
And in a bizarre episode at the Pentagon today, a woman claiming to be a defense contractor who had recently traveled to Liberia got on a shuttle bus, then said she felt sick and got off and threw up. This created a lot of investigation here in Washington this afternoon over whether the people on the bus should be quarantined and whether the first responders should also be tested. But our contacts tonight tell us that once they got that woman to the hospital, and they got on the path to testing her for Ebola, she quickly revealed that she had made the entire story up -- Greta?
VAN SUSTEREN: Catherine, that falls under the headline ""never dull.""
Thank you, Catherine.
And the nation's new so-called Ebola czar, Ron Klain, is a former chief of staff to Vice President Biden and an Obama White House advisor. Now that has many asking, why did President Obama chose political appointee instead of medical expert to lead the Ebola fight.
Joining us, our political panel, ""The Hill's"" editor-in-chief, Bob Cusack; ""The Washington Post's"" Jackie Kucinich; and ""The Washington Examiner's"" chief political correspondent, Byron York.
Byron, I don't know why we needed a czar. I would have been happy to have the secretary at the cabinet level, Burwell, do it. But anyway, I don't get to make that call, but how about Ron Klain.
BYRON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: If they did choose one, why did they choose one without any medical experience? It's a big question mark. The White House says they did it because he has extensive managerial experience. They have pointed to the fact that he was in Vice President Biden's office when the administration was handing out billions and billions of dollars in the stimulus, which worked across a bunch of government agencies. They have point to that to as his main experience. Is that transferable to dealing with Ebola? I just don't know.
But the last problem is he doesn't report to the president himself. He reports to the top national security bureaucracy. You wonder if it's adding another layer into this so far bureaucracy.
VAN SUSTEREN: I don't know if you wonder. I think it's practically a given that it's adding another layer.
Anyway, Jackie, your thought on this?
JACKIE KUCINICH, THE WASHINGTON POST: I think he knows how to navigate the bureaucracy and they trust him. Trust is a big deal to this particular White House. I think that's another reason why --
(CROSSTALK)
VAN SUSTEREN: Navigate bureaucracy. We're trying to figure out how to deal with all these hospitals and patients.
(CROSSTALK)
KUCINICH: Which is also a bureaucracy in a way. And also he has a relationship with the Hill, which is -- he worked for Biden when he was at the Senate Judiciary Committee as well. So this is also someone who knows how to navigate those personalities as well, which they are, at the White House, not too good at.
VAN SUSTEREN: I know. It sounds to me like they are hiring a baseball player to play football on weekends.
But anyway, Bob?
BOB CUSACK, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE HILL: Greta, I grant it's an unusual pick, but it is the administration's prerogative. If he doesn't do well, we will still be talking about this issue.
I did think they needed to bring somebody in because, at the press conference this week on the second patient in Dallas, there was no one from the federal government at that press conference. That's outrageous.
VAN SUSTEREN: Why? We have people -- we have a cabinet level, we have the HHS secretary. When we had the anthrax scare, we had Tommy Thompson who took charge.
 

(CROSSTALK)
VAN SUSTEREN: What's wrong with having Secretary Burwell do it?
CUSACK: Maybe Burwell, but Frieden has lost credibility. He said hospitals were equipped to do this. Clearly wrong.
VAN SUSTEREN: Fine, get Burwell. She's his boss.
YORK: We also have a president -- and at the White House news conference this week, Josh Earnest said -this is before the appointment of Klain -- said that the national security advisor was integrating the response. They said, OK< does that mean she is in charge? He said, no, not really. He listed all these other agencies. They said, is there any one person in charge you? You would expect him to answer ""the president of the United States"" --
(CROSSTALK)
YORK: -- and he didn't.
VAN SUSTEREN: I wouldn't expect him because, on August 11th, this is what the president said about Ebola -- so I'm not so sure I'd be surprised he can't answer that question. On August 1st, he said in part, ""Keep in mind that Ebola is not something that is easily transmitted. That's why generally outbreaks dissipate.""
Well, if it's not easily transmitted, how come people in hazmat suits? Dr. Brantly got Ebola. On August 1st, he doesn't even think it's very contagious.
KUCINICH: That's why they needed to bring someone else in. And, yeah --
(CROSSTALK)
VAN SUSTEREN: But don't they all know that?
(CROSSTALK)
YORK: Is that because the president has lost his credibility?
KUCINICH: Hey, I'm just saying it seems like this is a political move, in a lot of ways, to say, OK, look, we are bringing in someone else who is just going to handle it.
VAN SUSTEREN: How about bringing in a doctor? Bring in Dr. Tom Coburn, U.S. Senate. Bring in a Republican who might at least put down some of the temperature on the political.
KUCINICH: That's a lot of the criticism that you are hearing that it should have been someone with some medical experience.
CUSACK: Burwell has got to deal with Obamacare so she has her hands full already.
VAN SUSTEREN: You aren't appalled by this choice?
CUSACK: I think it's an unusual pick. Some Democrats --
(CROSSTALK)
VAN SUSTEREN: Unusual or appalled?
CUSACK: Well, let's see how he does.
YORK: This is a political choice. One operative today told ""The New York Times"" that Klain would help with messaging and turning down the political heat on that. That's what this is about.
VAN SUSTEREN: It is inconceivable to me that we are talking about making political choices when many in the nation, whether rightfully or wrongfully, are terrified of Ebola. And we have hospitals turning people away who have symptoms like Mr. Duncan. It is inconceivable that everyone in Washington is stepping all over each other adding to the bureaucracy and picking someone with no experience. Maybe it's just me.
KUCINICH: It's the midterms. It's the midterms. They're so close.
(LAUGHTER)
 

VAN SUSTEREN: But sometimes -- you know, if we were a little bit smarter. In fact, if we paid attention to the World Health Organization in March, we wouldn't have this problem. But anyway.
YORK: The best way to deal with the politics of this is to deal with the substance of it successfully and show that you are on top of things.
VAN SUSTEREN: Indeed, thank you, panel.
There is growing outrage over the CDC's Ebola response. Many Americans are wondering how at risk health care workers were allowed to board airplanes and cruise ships. And only afterwards, CDC Director Tom Frieden saying, from, now on no, one else involved in Thomas Duncan's care will be able to travel other than in a controlled environment, meaning non- public transportation.
Senator John McCain joins us.
Good evening, sir.
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN, (R), ARIZONA: Good evening.
VAN SUSTEREN: Your thought tonight? We have a cruise ship, bus in Washington. Questionable things going on right now. People traveling on airplanes. What should he be doing?
MCCAIN: First thing we should be doing is declaring that anyone in one of those countries now afflicted with Ebola, if they want to come to the United States, they should be quarantined for 21 days and then given a blood test. There should be no one coming from those countries to the United States of America unless we are absolutely sure that they have not been tainted by Ebola. Until we do that, in my view, we are putting the American people in danger.
And I would also like to say that the appointment of Mr. Klain, who has no experience whatsoever on this or any other medical issue, is a lobbyist and a Democrat apparatchik, frankly, does not fill the bill for a czar and the capabilities because he has no experience or knowledge or background in medicine.
MCCAIN: I know that you were -- or you are in favor of a czar. Maybe not Mr. Klain. I disagree with that. And I'm curious if you think I'm wrong. But that's sort of the job of the secretary of HHS. Tommy Thompson was the secretary in the anthrax scare. We do have someone with that job. Now that we have a czar, we introduce a whole new bureaucracy. We have turf wars on who is supposed to do what. We already have a cabinet level person, a secretary of HHS, who answers to the president. Why do we need a czar?
MCCAIN: For weeks now, there has been no one in charge. You're right. Logically, it should have been secretary of HHS, Sylvia Burwell, very capable individual. But there was nobody. That's why some of us said, look, who is in charge? Put somebody in charge. He could have made her the czar. But the American people need to look to someone who has the knowledge, expertise, background, can assure them we are taking the measures necessary. And frankly, I don't think Mr. Klain fits the bill as a partisan Democrat. Certainly not in any effort to address this issue in a bipartisan fashion.
VAN SUSTEREN: Back in March, the World Health Organization reported a rash of cases of Ebola, the first ever seen in Africa. So what in the world have we been doing since March 23rd? And had we done something, maybe Mr. Duncan wouldn't have come here to the United States.
MCCAIN: I think one thing that is very clear, is that we have been reassured, obviously, falsely. We were assured by the ahead of the CDC and other administration officials that Ebola wouldn't come to the United States of America. Now there is allegation that this woman called the CDC saying, I have got a temperature, can I fly on an airplane, and they say go ahead. That's what happens when you have a lack of leadership and discipline.
And that isn't just this issue. It's the IRS. It's the Secret Service. Frankly, it's also our entire approach to the situation in the Middle East and in Iraq and Syria, which continues to deteriorate. Is there anybody who believes that what we're doing now will degrade and destroy ISIS? I don't know of anyone.
VAN SUSTEREN: All right. So, I guess that you haven't named the person, but do you believe the blame squarely falls on President Obama being, sort of, you know, slow to react to these crises?
MCCAIN: Of course. But he has been slow to every one. And that's what leaders are supposed to be. I hearken back to Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan would have been on national television looking in the camera and saying, ""My fellow Americans, we are facing a crisis here and here is what I am doing because I'm in charge, and here are the people that you can look to."" There's ways of addressing crises and it requires, first of all, presidential leadership. That has been missing throughout the last six years.
 

VAN SUSTEREN: It's very disheartening that we knew March 23rd from the World Health Organization and, apparently, it got no attention until it has now exploded all over us. Hopefully, this is the end of it and it's not going to get bigger.
But anyway, Senator, thank you.
And who would Senator McCain have chosen to be the Ebola czar, you wonder? Go to Gretawire.com and hear his answer.
Up next, Charles Krauthammer says the U.S. government is still steps behind the Ebola virus. That sounds very grim since Ebola moves very fast. Charles Krauthammer goes ON THE RECORD next.
Plus, tonight, there is Ebola vaccine being tested on humans. We are going to take you inside that government lab where it's being done, a tour you will only get right here ON THE RECORD, coming up.
And, of course, everyone is asking about Bentley. He is Nurse Nina Pham's dog. He is in quarantine, too. See how Bentley is doing for yourself. Stay tuned.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
VAN SUSTEREN: Dallas Nurse Nina Pham is right being called a hero in her community. She got Ebola while taking care of dying Liberian patient. And now, her family's friend, Tom Ha, is slamming the Obama administration and the CDC for their handling the crisis.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
TOM HA, FAMILY FRIEND OF NINA PHAM: I'm very surprised at the level of -- I have to say -incompetence of not only the administration, but also the CDC. They seem to be unable to have a well-organized program to handle a crisis at this level.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
VAN SUSTEREN: So is President Obama leading or struggling to play catch up in responding to the Ebola crisis?
Charles Krauthammer says, ""The U.S. public health services remains steps behind the Ebola virus.""
And joining us, Charles Krauthammer, author of ""Things that Matter,"" a book that sold more than a million copies.
Charles, slow to respond?
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR & AUTHOR: Slow to respond and always behind. You hear the administration today say, well, a travel ban is not off the table. We have been hearing for weeks it is a terrible idea, it will make it worse. It's the most logical thing to do. British Airways is not flying into these countries. And it will be done. It's only a question of time.
But on the other end of it, where the CDC has been assuring us, we know how to handle this, we know how to trace contacts. Yes, but they don't know what to tell and handle the people once they have identified the contacts. You can't tell people, as we are even now doing, to self- quarantine. Ordinary people have no idea what that means. You have to have a government step in. And I would say -- this is not a thing that we like to do -- override civil liberties. We're going to have to quarantine a lot of folks who have come in contact. That's the way you control an epidemic like this.
VAN SUSTEREN: You know, you talk about tracing contacts. I guess that I take -- you know, and the president, the government, the administration being slow to respond. I take it back even further. I think it's lousy that we are in a position of tracing contacts. We had notice at least as early as March. We could have stopped -- we could have headed it off at the pass before it even got here and helped a lot of people in a lot of these Western African nations. So it's not even, sort of, not knowing how to trace the contracts. Everyone was asleep at the wheel.
KRAUTHAMMER: I'm not sure we could have stopped the spread in Western Africa.
VAN SUSTEREN: But we could have stopped it coming here?
KRAUTHAMMER: Well, if we had a travel ban, if we had real controls. For example, the suggestion that we heard from Senator McCain makes perfect sense. Anybody who wants to come into the United States, you spend 21 days in quarantine in the Liberia, say, we'll give you a big space, a flat screen tv, excellent
 

American food and lots of entertainment, but you have got to wait 21 days and then you come here. That's elementary.
VAN SUSTEREN: Well, I don't see that happening.
Let me turn to the czar, which I'm opposed to, but whatever. He has chosen Ron Klain.
KRAUTHAMMER: Look, it's a farce. It's a public relations maneuver. Here we are, looking at epidemic, and as we heard from Byron York, there is an official quoted in the ""Times"" today saying that ""Klain was chosen because is he good at messaging."" This isn't a messaging issue. This is an epidemic issue. This is a medical issue. I don't think is he going to do any good one way or the other. I don't think is he going to do any harm. But it's the way the administration responds. It thinks that it's failures on all fronts is a matter of messaging, public relations, rather than the substance. You want to calm the public? Show that you have a handle on the epidemic, that you know how to quarantine people, that you will impose a ban on travel if you have to.
And one thing I don't understand is why do they wait a day or two to release the name of a victim? If you want people to be aware of any contact, the fastest way to make them aware is to release the name. But, of course, for reasons of privacy, we don't. That is completely misplaced. We have to get out of those habits and understand we have got a serious issue here.
VAN SUSTEREN: Charles, always nice to see you. Thank you.
KRAUTHAMMER: Pleasure.
VAN SUSTEREN: And straight ahead, how do we know if an Ebola vaccine will really work? You have to take the vaccine and then expose yourself to live Ebola virus? Well, the lab where the vaccine is being tested is next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
VAN SUSTEREN: Now you are going to get a rare inside look at the testing of an Ebola vaccine. Yesterday, we took you to the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research where the first vaccine test on humans in the United States has just begun. Tonight, we are taking you inside that lab where they are performing those critical tests.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
VAN SUSTEREN: Whether you're testing HIV or Ebola or some others, the procedures are all the same?
(CROSSTALK)
VAN SUSTEREN: There's nothing that's significant, that's particular for a particular virus?
LT. COL. JASON REGULES, EBOLA VACCINE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR, WALTER REED ARMY INSTITUTE OF RESEARCH: It might be something in particular. The general procedures are generally the same, or basically the same. It takes a little bit of fine tuning for each different pathogen that you are going to test. It's kind of like, you know, everyone can cook the cake generally the same way, but getting it out correctly.
VAN SUSTEREN: So what do we have here?
And by the way, nice to meet you. I'm Greta.
I'm told not to touch anything, so I'm not going to shake your hand or anything. Explain this to me.
REGULES: So, this particular laboratory does PCR normally for HIV testing of service members in the military.
VAN SUSTEREN: PCR meaning what?
REGULES: Preliminary chain reaction, testing for ribonucleic acid testing virus for potentially infected person (inaudible) in this case from the HIV Virus. And they are able to count and detect for genetic mutation (inaudible) what their assay is specific for the (inaudible). So this lab, (inaudible) and they have been kind enough, (inaudible) Ebola vaccine testing (inaudible) a PTR test. That's where the genetic material in the vaccine virus helps us quantitate that.
VAN SUSTEREN: So how do you do that? Give the 101.
 

REGULES: So you would take either saliva or a swab of saliva. So we take three different types of samples for this particular trial, plasma, take blood thin it down and get the plasma, no cells in there.
VAN SUSTEREN: So that's the blood spun into the yellow, basically?
REGULES: Yes.
VAN SUSTEREN: OK.
REGULES: And it has some amount of the virus in there from the vaccine.
VAN SUSTEREN: It's actually spun.
REGULES: It is actually spun, spun in the centrifuge and they pull it and it doesn't have any cells. And then, we take a little portion, put it into, freeze it down, send it over to these guys, and they are able to test it in their PTR assay, to see if there is virus in there. We also have urine samples that we send to them and also do a swab in the mouth that we put into a special storage lab and they can also test that.
VAN SUSTEREN: Right. You test it for what? To see if it has the virus or create the vaccine? What are you testing it on?
REGULES: Well, again, with the focus on safety and how the vaccine behaves and individuals that are vaccinated, you want to see how long it's in your blood. OK. You want to see if we can detect it, if there is a virus from the vaccine that's detected from the saliva, and also shed in the urine. So common stage, places we can get -- you might be able to detect vaccine virus. And we'll be able to track how long it's there.
VAN SUSTEREN: So at what point in this whole vaccine testing, when do you do all these?
REGULES: So every day individuals come early period, nonhuman primate studies, the monkeys tested with the similar vaccine. You know, typically early on in the trial. After they were vaccinated, they had a short period where you could detect the vaccine virus in their bodies, and so forth and then trial volunteers, getting sampled very early after vaccination and following them until they are negative, that we can't defect it anymore.
VAN SUSTEREN: This is your record keeping basically, probably the track record of how the vaccines are doing?
REGULES: Yes.
(CROSSTALK)
VAN SUSTEREN: I asked this earlier and I'm still confused, if I go through the whole trial, I'm fine or everything is fine, how do I know if I am vaccinated against Ebola? Don't I have to go out and expose myself or is there some test?
REGULES: So when you go out and expose yourself.
(CROSSTALK)
VAN SUSTEREN: How do you know if a vaccine works?
REGULES: So again, there is typically two ways. I will compare it to it -- I will do another scenario, malaria. We do a lot of malaria vaccines here. We have a unique capability called a challenged model. So normally when you vaccinate, you know, you can do all your nice preclinical work or parallel work in nonhuman primates or monkeys, vaccinate them with a similar product in a similar manner. Those animals can be tested against the disease such as Ebola you can get a good estimate of how good you think that vaccine works. However, the monkeys are not people. So, in people, we measure immune response and see if we get similar immune responses to the monkeys or if we can get an immune response with that or other vaccines need to be -- show similar like protective level of protection or suggestion of protection. Otherwise, traditionally, you have to go and do field trials.
VAN SUSTEREN: Which is when they get Ebola or not.
REGULES: Which is whether you get Ebola or not.
VAN SUSTEREN: Or malaria.
REGULES: Malaria trial, you have to go to a place with malaria. With malaria, we have what's called (inaudible). We grow malaria here and raise your own mosquitoes and do it in a very controlled setting. It's a
 

great advantage. We can go within our own building vaccinate and assess people for did the malaria vaccine work for you? It helps us develop that particular vaccine. For Ebola, we can't do that. We have no challenge model for Ebola. So really again it's going to take looking at the animal and field trial.
VAN SUSTEREN: I understand some vaccines may work for you but not for me, right, a particular vaccine? Is it also true that a vaccine, let's say the polio vaccine may be more effective than the malaria vaccine? I mean, the vaccines have different efficacies?
REGULES: They do. Vaccines have different efficacies. Vaccines have different rates of response and people. It all depends on the construct of the vaccine.

VAN SUSTEREN: And you can see more of our interview and tour at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, just go to Gretawire.com.
And Nigeria and Boko Haram reportedly reaching a deal to release hundreds of kidnapped school girls, the latest. Plus, we will talk with a Christian man shot in the face Boko Haram just because he is Christian. This man is here next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
VAN SUSTEREN: This is a Fox News alert. The Nigerian government and Islamic extremist, Boko Haram, agreeing to a ceasefire. And the deal would reportedly secure the release of hundreds of kidnapped school girls. If you remember, back on April 14th, the terrorist group kidnapped more than 270 girls from their school. So far, no word on when or if the girls will actually be released. Of course, there is much concern about their condition. There have been reports of mass rape and even sale of some of the girls.
And a Nigerian Christian man shot in the face by Boko Haram says the school girls' kidnapping brought back memories of his own terrifying ordeal. We spoke with survivor Habila Adamu.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
VAN SUSTEREN: Tell me what happened. What kind of day was it?
HABILA ADAMU, BOKO HARAM SURVIVOR: Yeah, it's a Wednesday 20th of November, 2012, around 11:00 p.m. The Boko Haram came to my house around 11 p.m. then meet me with my family and ordered me to come out, I did so.
VAN SUSTEREN: Did you know them? Ever seen them before?
ADAMU: No. They have covered their face and there are four of them with AK-47. Ordered me to come out, and I did so. One of them told my wife that I'm here to do the work of Allah. I knew that they had to kill me and what I did, I prayed to God and I submitted myself to God, and surrendered myself to God.
VAN SUSTEREN: So there are four men there. Did the four men say anything to you?
ADAMU: Yeah, (inaudible) I told them that I'm a Christian.
VAN SUSTEREN: You knew that was an answer that was a death sentence?
ADAMU: Yes. And one of them dealt with me if I can change my mind, I can live a long life. And I say no.
VAN SUSTEREN: And?
ADAMU: One of them fired an AK-47.
VAN SUSTEREN: Hitting you where?
ADAMU: From my nose. The bullet passed through my nose. This is the entering vessel (ph) AK-47, through my nose.
VAN SUSTEREN: And this is still going on in your area right now?
ADAMU: Yeah. They still go in.
VAN SUSTEREN: Worse? I mean, do they it more often?
ADAMU: Always. It is becoming worse.
 

EMMANUEL OGEBE, ATTORNEY FOR BOKO HARAM SURVIVOR: In fact, Greta, if I may, what has happened is that is like ISIS, Boko Haram has not capture territory, and we're hearing horrendous massacres. They actually released videos showing the killing of Christians. But again, the global spotlight is not there.
VAN SUSTEREN: You know, look, I am one show. You know, thankfully, we have a big audience and we have Gretawire with it, what I don't understand is that why there is not more attention from the American media, actually the international media, on what's going on in Nigeria by Boko Haram, is equal to what's going on with ISIS, actually killed more than ISIS, if we're doing numbers.
ADAMU: Yes.
OGEBE: If we're doing numbers, doing nationalities because Boko Haram has killed people from over 15 countries including Norway, Britain, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany. They have a whole smorgasbord of people they have killed. But somehow, they're still forced notion that this is about economic inequality in the country. No, it's not. It's about jihad. It's the same spirit. It's the same ideology. It's the same theology.
VAN SUSTEREN: If you are a Christian, you are dead.
ADAMU: You are a Christian, if you are an infidel.
VAN SUSTEREN: How many people did they kill that night?
OGEBE: Fourteen.
VAN SUSTEREN: Fourteen that night.
ADAMU: Fourteen that night. I'm the sole survivor.
OGEBE: He's the sole survivor.
VAN SUSTEREN: And you knew everyone was killed that night?
ADAMU: Yeah, yeah. The Christians, we know each other. We know each other. We are few. Before, they only kill the men and leave the women. But now, they have changed it. They will kill even the little ones, 2 years, 1 year old. (Inaudible).
VAN SUSTEREN: What's this beheading and putting the head in the body? What is it with that?
(CROSSTALK)
VAN SUSTEREN: Is it more cruel? Is it what they think is just more cruel than shooting someone in the head? What's the point of that?
OGEBE: Yeah, because they have seen some people surviving.
VAN SUSTEREN: The head shot?
OGEBE: Yeah.
VAN SUSTEREN: Oh, so this is a guarantee because you lived.
OGEBE: Yeah.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
VAN SUSTEREN: And you can see more of this Christian man's story. Our full interview is posted on Gretawire.com.
And straight ahead, reports that ISIS now has fighter jets and the former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and Syria joins us. That's next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
VAN SUSTEREN: Well, was this disturbing? A report tonight that Iraqi pilots have joined ISIS and trained members of ISIS to fly captured fighter jets. That is according to a Syrian activist group, but the U.S. central command says it is not aware of ISIS flying jets in Syria. Joining us, former Iraq and Syria ambassador Ryan Crocker. He is now dean of the Bush School of Government at Texas A&M University. Good evening, sir.
RYAN CROCKER, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ AND SYRIA: Good evening.
 

VAN SUSTEREN: Sir, was the deterioration of Iraq inevitable or did we make some blunders that we can now learn from as we go forward in time?
CROCKER: I think we made some mistakes. The Iraqis made some mistakes. Good news there is that mistakes can be corrected. I don't see inevitability about it. The mistake we made was not just with withdrawing our troops at the end of 2011, but also putting an end to high level political engagement. The Iraqi system won't run on its own. It's not mature enough. It takes us in the middle. We pulled ourselves out and I think that led to where we are today. It can be corrected if we get back in the game in a big way couldn't.
VAN SUSTEREN: All right. As I understand, we couldn't get a status of forces agreement. There's a lot of disagreement about whether we could have gotten one or not gotten one. In your opinion, could we have gotten a status of forces agreement which would have enabled us to withdraw in a different manner?
CROCKER: Well, we got one in 2008 when I was ambassador. I think we could have gotten one again, if we had perhaps taken a different tact. But, you know, we can argue about that all we want, the reality is we now have a status of forces agreement in exchange of letters. It was accomplished in a few hours. This is time for a new era, and a time for the U.S. to reengage.
VAN SUSTEREN: What would you recommend now, in light of where we are now, what's the best way to sort of put a lid on this and move forward in the best way?
CROCKER: Several things. First, the main effort right now I believe has to be political. I think Secretary Kerry is going to have to be spending a lot of time in Baghdad. I think Secretary Hagel has got to do the same, as we work with the Iraqis to make sure they have inclusive government that brings in Sunnies, Shia, Kurds in a common front against a common enemy. That's only going to happen if we do some high level heavy lifting.
The second thing is I think we need to substantially increase the number of our special forces deployed to Iraq and as the Iraqis regroup their military forces with our help and that will be a heavy lift, too, we need to start embedding our advisors with their forces at least down to the battalion level. They can fight, we have seen it in the past, but they need to have us with them if there is going to be hope of rolling is back inside Iraq.
VAN SUSTEREN: Well, there is always so much to discuss. We are always so short of time. I regret to have this short, ambassador. I do hope you come back. I also know you spent time in Syria, and that you have a rich history and experience help us all learn. Thank you, sir.
CROCKER: Thank you.
VAN SUSTEREN: Coming up, many of you have been asking about Bentley, nurse Nina Pham's dog, now in quarantine, too. You are going to hear how Bentley is doing straight from the kind people taking care of him, next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
VAN SUSTEREN: Have you been many of you have been asking about Bentley, Nurse Nina Pham's dog. While Pham is being treated for Ebola in an NIH isolation unit, her dog Bentley is also being quarantined. So how is he doing? Griff Jenkins reports from Dallas.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
KATE MCMANUS: Bentley is doing great. He is a wonderful little dog.
GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS: Dr. Kate McManus is a vet overseeing Bentley Pham, the puppy currently being monitored for symptoms of Ebola.
MCMANUS: He is away from his mom. He is away from his home. He is in a strange environment being handled by people with space suits. He still just wants love. He is eating great. So that's always a good sign.
JENKINS: It's called operation Bentley. The mission to save this dog now under quarantine after his owner, Nina Pham, contracted the Ebola virus.
MCMANUS: We really don't know what the possibility is for a dog to be shedding the virus. And we do know he has been exposed to his mom.
JENKINS: It's a mission led by Jody Jones, director of Dallas animal services.
 

JODY JONES, DALLASANIMALS.org: The dog is going to be here with us for a couple of days. The quarantine period is 21 days that they're recommending. And we want to make sure that we can keep him as comfortable and happy during the 21 days as possible. JENKINS: But comfortable and happy is a tall order for a dog in full quarantine. JONES: He is treated very much like a patient that would be cared for -- that had the Ebola virus as far as lack of contact, direct contact with him. JENKINS: But for Nina and her puppy, some comfort amid the crisis. MCMANUS: I talked to Nina the other night. I said the biggest thing we have to worry about is your dog being fatter than a house by the time he gets out. JENKINS: What did Nina say? MCMANUS: She laughed. I said we will deal with that issue when you guys are back together. (END VIDEO CLIP) VAN SUSTEREN: OK. Let's all go off-the-record for a minute. Of course, without any doubt, saving lives, protecting the national security and preventing the spread of Ebola highest priority. You know that, I know that, but I know some of you are curious about nurse Pham's dog, Bentley. I confess I am, is the pup going to get Ebola? I have no idea. I suspect not, but I don't know. We do know that he is being taken cared, I'm glad of that and I know you are, too, because you have all emailed me asking about Bentley. Some of you have even mentioned in your emails that maybe you should not be asking about a dog in a time like this, obviously, mindful of the fact that human lives are on the line. But I see nothing wrong thinking about our dog. We can do both, humans and pets. They are often our best friends. They are innocent, not judgmental. Always wagging their tails when you get home even if you are late. It also occurred to me as I am now thinking about your emails how different we Americans are from those savages like ISIS from Boko Haram. They have no regard for human life and behead innocent and meanwhile, we scramble to help those in great need even little dogs. That's my off-the-record comment tonight. Thank you for being with us. We'll see you again Monday night right here at 7:00 p.m. Eastern. And right now, I want to tell you go to Fox News Go and the Fox News app because in the foxnewsgo.com, you can always watch On The Record any time, any day. But in the meantime, go to Gretawire.com, answer this question. Was Ron Klain the right choice for Ebola czar or a political choice? Vote in our pole. Good night from Washington, D.C.

-- Peter Nicholas: Obama Still Hunts for a Catchy Slogan
-- Voters Are Excited About Nobody as Midterms Loom
-- Video: What Will NATO Do If ISIS Attacks Turkey? TURKEY, U.S. WARN SYRIAN CITY WILL SOON FALL: Turkey and the U.S. warned that a major Syrian border city was in imminent danger of falling to Islamic State , with the two countries putting the onus on the other to halt the extremist group's advance. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pressed the U.S.-led coalition to move ahead with plans to arm and train Syrian and Iraqi ground forces to battle Islamic State , saying airstrikes alone weren't enough. An American military official said the U.S. believes the situation in the predominantly Kurdish city of Kobani is increasingly dire, and that the city is likely to fall shortly if Turkey doesn't intervene.
The complications for Turkey stemming from the advance on Kobani are mounting rapidly. Beyond U.S. pressure to step in, protests by the country's restive Kurds were spreading quickly. At least a dozen people were killed in clashes with security forces in several Kurdish-majority cities, local media reported. The demonstrations reached Istanbul. Airstrikes on Tuesday by the coalition fighting Islamic State hit positions near Kobani, but Kurdish officials and Syrian opposition members said the militants were still advancing against Syrian Kurdish fighters. Ayla Albayrak, Nour Malas and Julian E. Barnes report . Plus: A breakdown of targets and locations the U.S.-led coalition has hit so far.

PETER NICHOLAS'S EARLY HIT: OBAMA STILL HUNTS FOR CATCHY SLOGAN
The Obama presidency is littered with catch phrases and rhetorical devices, enthusiastically embraced and summarily discarded as tastes and political needs change. None has piqued the public's imagination. ""Let me be clear,"" he likes to say -- and keep saying. Does the phrase help the president cut through the cacophony in Washington? Read Peter Nicholas's full post in Washington Wire .
STORIES YOU SHOULDN'T MISS
U.S. VOTERS ARE EXCITED ABOUT NOBODY: Republicans hold a clear edge as the midterm campaign heads into its stretch run. But the party's advantage springs more from intense anti-Obama feelings than from a wave of voters who believe Republicans will transform Washington. Indeed, disillusionment with politics may help explain why Republicans' edge isn't wider at a time when job approval ratings of the Democratic president have slid into the 40% range. Just one month before the Nov. 4 election, it isn't even clear what
 

exactly the midterms are about. No single issue dominates, except unhappiness with the status quo. Janet Hook reports .
W.VA.'S RIGHTWARD TILT PUTS DEMOCRATS ON DEFENSE: The midterm election could be a watershed moment for Republicans in West Virginia, as the former Democratic bastion continues to move to the right. The state next month appears likely to elect its first Republican to the U.S. Senate in 55 years, and the GOP could also win a majority in the House of Delegates for the first time in more than 80 years. Why the rightward tilt? Part of the reason is strong antipathy toward President Obama and his administration's energy policies, most notably stricter limits on power-plan emissions. Kris Maher reports .
MOST MIGRANTS MAKE THEIR COURT DATE: The vast majority of migrants who recently entered the U.S. illegally are showing up for their scheduled deportation hearings, even as the government said most adults who arrived with children have skipped separate required check-ins with immigration offices. Between July 18 and Sept. 30, about 85% of unaccompanied minors showed up for a scheduled first hearing, and about two-thirds of adults with children appeared. The majority of cases involving recent border crossers are still working their way through immigration court. Miriam Jordan reports .
THE LATEST ON EBOLA: U.S. military specialists highly trained in dealing with biological threats have been sent to Liberia to operate mobile laboratories being set up to test blood samples for the Ebola virus ... The husband and a co-worker of a Spanish nurse's aide who was infected with Ebola in Madrid have been placed in quarantine ... ... The fate of the Spanish nurse's aide's dog is sparking an outcry in Spain ... Health-care workers face Ebola risks , in part because of the elaborate protocol involved in treating victims of the virus.

NEW WSJ EBOOK EXAMINES FDA'S ROLE IN CONTROVERSIAL SURGICAL TOOL: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned gynecologists in April that a tool used in some minimally-invasive hysterectomies could spread hidden and dangerous uterine cancer. But the agency is still weighing what to do about the device known as a laparoscopic power morcellator, and some doctors are still using it . A new Wall Street Journal ebook, "" Deadly Medicine: A Common Surgery for Women and the Cancer It Leaves Behind,"" explores the issue in depth through the story of a Boston doctor who became a vocal critic of the procedure when her cancer was worsened by the tool. The book is free to download. Jennifer Levitz and Jon Kamp report .
VIDEO: WHAT WILL NATO DO IF ISIS ATTACKS TURKEY?
If Islamic State decides to take the fight into Turkey, the 28 countries included in the NATO alliance may be called on to protect one of its member nations.
HERE'S A LOOK AT THE DAY AHEAD
-- THE PRESIDENT: The president has a conference call with state and local officials at 2:20 p.m. to discuss the administration's response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. He will then go to the Pentagon where at 3 p.m. he meets with the military's senior leadership and at 4 p.m. he meets with the National Security Council to receive an update on the campaign to fight Islamic State .
-- THE FED : The Federal Reserve releases minutes from its September interest-rate meeting at 2 p.m.
WHAT WE'RE READING AROUND THE WEB
President Obama's declaration that all his policies are on the ballot this fall may have been simply a ploy to motivate core Democrats to show up in November, writes David A. Graham of The Atlantic. In midterm elections, ""the trick to winning is to maximize base turnout. For Democrats in the South, that means black voters.""
Voters are registering deep dissatisfaction with the political system with one month to go before the election, writes Josh Kraushaar , and ""candidates who come across as wheeling-and-dealing political insiders are
 

underperforming, regardless of their partisan identification. Those who successfully portray themselves as problem-solving outsiders have a chance to ride the wave."" Time's Teresa Berenson lists the five most dishonest political ads of 2014. Three come from Democrats, one from a Republican and one from the NRA. The New Yorker's Evan Osnos profiles Harvard legal professor Lawrence Lessig and his creation of a Super PAC devoted to supporting candidates who will help eliminate Super PACs. The effort has ""the biggest chance to fail of anything I've ever done,"" Lessig says. In the WSJ's Think Tank, Robin Wright explains the strategic importance of the fight with Islamic State over control of Kobani, a city on the Syrian-Turkish border. That location ""has long been the route of trains and trucks between Turkey and Syria. So whoever controls Kobani also controls a gateway on an important border."" MILESTONE The U.S. has reduced oil imports from countries such as Iraq and Russia by 30% over the last decade. Yet in California, imports have shot up by a third to account for more than half the state's oil supply.

3 October 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"3 October 2014 11:01 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2014 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Maputo, Oct 03, 2014 (Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- The team of international military observers who will monitor the agreement on the cessation of hostilities between the Mozambican government and the former rebel movement Renamo took office in Maputo on Wednesday, and should begin its activities immediately.
The team, known by the acronym EMOCHM, is headed by a Botswanan brigadier, Therego Seretse, He will be assisted by four colonels - one from Zimbabwe, one from Italy and two from Mozambique (one appointed by the government and the other by Renamo).
EMOCHM should consist of observers from nine countries - Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Cape Verde, Kenya, Italy, Portugal, Britain and the United States. But so far only the observers from the first four of these countries have arrived.
US ambassador Douglas Griffiths told reporters that his country had prioritised the battle against ebola in West Africa, and was dispatching 300 military personnel to help the government of Liberia fight against this lethal disease.
A Portuguese representative said that his country, which is due to send a colonel to the northern province of Nampula and a major to Sofala in the centre of the country, preferred to wait until the central command of EMOCHM in Maputo was established.
One diplomatic source told AIM that some countries are reluctant to send their observers until more details are available as to what the mission will do. The agreement between the government and Renamo is vague, and gives no firm timetable for disarming the Renamo militia and incorporating its army into the army, the police or back into civilian life.
EMOCHM has 135 days to complete its mission - but this period can be extended if necessary. When complete, the mission will consist of 93 men - 23 foreign observers, and 70 Mozambicans (half from the government and half from Renamo). The central command under Seretse will be based in Maputo and there will be four subunits in Sofala, Inhambane, Tete and Nampula provinces.
Speaking at the Wednesday ceremony, the head of the government delegation to the dialogue with Renamo, Agriculture Minister Jose Pacheco, claimed that the dialogue has produced consensus for the preservation of definitive peace in the country.
""At the end of the day, no party will have military equipment"", he said. ""It is in this context that the military observation team has been set up"".
He said that the main task of EMOCHM will be to observe and monitor the integration into the Mozambican armed forces (FADM) of what are referred to euphemistically as the ""residual forces"" of Renamo.
""We would like to be able to rely on your experience of transparency in this process"", Pacheco told the observers.
The head of the Renamo delegation, Saimone Macuiana, claimed that this day ""opens a new page in the history of the country, a new page that will guarantee genuine reconciliation, which is the indispensable condition for genuine and lasting peace"".",International Military Observers Take Office,All Africa AFNWS English

Oct 02, 2014 (The Guardian/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- THE insurrection in the north eastern part of Nigeria instigated by the extremist group, Jamatul ahalus sunnah wal da'awati wal jahad commonly referred to as Boko Haram is steadily deteriorating into a major internal conflict as what started in 2006 with pockets of attacks and occasional bombings of churches and public buildings with improvised explosive devise [IED] has snowballed into a full blown war where the insurgents have proclaimed a part of the country as the Sultanate Caliphate. It is on record that in addition to the huge loss of life and property, this is one conflict that has fully stretched the resources of the Federal Government as well as much of the revenue accruing to any state or local government in any part of Nigeria since the end of the civil war.
As at the last count, the Borno State capital was under siege after the fall of Bama, a town situated only 70 kilometers away from Maiduguri and the second largest local government area in the state. In the meantime, the Nigerian armed forces are yet to 'liberate' Gwoza, Damboa, Buni-Yadi, Madagali, Gamboru-Ngala, Gulak, Mihika, Duhu, Shuwa and Kirshinga [the list is growing by the day] which indicates that the situation is getting out of hand. A state of affairs where a band of ragamuffins now dictates the pace in a war of attrition and in the process making the army to look ordinary portend grave consequences for the socio-economic wellbeing of this country, given the propensity, among separatist elements, to cash in on political, ethnic or religious crisis to call for the partitioning of Nigeria. Troops of the Joint Task Force [JTF] code named Operation Restore Hope have been stationed in the Niger Delta since the last 15 years to forestall recurrence of militancy after an attempt to resurrect the spirit of the botch Niger Delta Republic was brutally repressed by the army.
The Nigeria Army has seen several battles within and outside the shores of the country in the last 50 years. It was shortly after the attainment of independence and at a time when the nation was still smarting from the euphoria of the freedom to take its destiny in its own hands, when on February 23 1966 the army had its baptism of fire by rising to quell the uprising led by Isaac Jasper Adaka Boro whose group, the Niger Delta Volunteer Force in show of braggadocio violently agitated for the excision of the Niger Delta Republic from the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The insurrection was swiftly put down within 12 days by soldiers and the culprits arrested and clamped into jail. This was followed by numerous political crises, inter-tribal and ethno-religious conflicts where the army was frequently relied upon to move in and return normalcy to the affected areas. Then there was the Nigerian Civil War beginning in May 1966 that was brought under control in less than three years or 30 months to be precise.
The Nigeria army that has excelled in the UN, AU and ECOWAS peace keeping missions in different parts of the world including Lebanon [1978], former Yugoslavia[1998], East Timor[1999], Liberia[1990-1999], Sierra Leone[1998-2005], Darfur [2004],Democratic Republic of the Congo [2004] Rwanda[1994] and recently Mali [2012] just to mention a few is now having the enviable position which it has earned for itself rubbished by Boko Haram. When the conflict in Sierra Leone became critical, it was Nigerian soldiers serving in peacekeeping mission in Liberia who in 1998 gallantly fought their way across the border to dislodge the brutal Revolutionary United Front [RUF] led by Foday Sankoh from Freetown. This bold effort afforded President Ahmad Tejan Kabba who had been overthrown a year earlier the rare opportunity of returning to power from Guinea where he had been exiled hitherto.
In the Liberia war that started in December 1989, the Economic Community of West African States [ECOWAS] cease-fire Monitoring Group [ECOMOG] that was composed of mainly Nigerian troops withstood the ferocious assault from different warring factions that had emerged in that country beginning with the rabid campaign by Charles Taylor and his National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL] that had sworn never to allow ECOMOG a foothold in their country. Other warring factions bent on exterminating ECOMOG troops at that time included the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia [INPFL], the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy [ULIMO] composed of former allies of President Samuel Doe and the numerous other splinter groups that emerged in the course of the war. Even with all the odds stacked against it, ECOMOG
 

combatants fought bravely and restored peace to Liberia to the admiration of the Liberian people, Africa as a whole as well as the world at large and to the pride of Nigeria.
The activities of the insurgent group has to a large extent demystified the army and is eroding the reverence and high esteem if not the awe with which the people held the armed forces of Nigeria who are generally believed to be indomitable, staunch and invincible. There is the need for the military to redeem its image by devising a strategy to rout the insurgents and bring their nefarious activities to a halt. This is more so when their recent offensives by Boko Haram is considered against the background of the low level of patriotic fervor prevailing among the citizens. If the rebels manage to hold the captured areas for long, within a short period of time, many people either out of coercion or persuasions will openly switch allegiance to the so called Sultanate Caliphate.
The seemingly intractable security challenges confronting Nigeria at the moment can be overcome if the army becomes more resourceful in deploying the available material and men to the best advantage. Nigeria has one of the largest armies in Africa second only to Egypt. The soldiers can be drafted to the occupied area in large numbers to stem the tide of the insurgents advance. The presence of soldiers in large numbers will serve a dual purpose of moral booster for the troops of the Joint Task Force [JTF] while at the same time lending a hand in the war against terrorism.
President Goodluck Jonathan has recently presented a provisional appropriation bill before the National Assembly requesting approval for a foreign loan of $1billion to procure equipment for the military. Much as the need to enhance capacity in the armed forces cannot be overemphasized, the immediate need of the army as far as the war against insurgency and internal insurrection is concerned is not the acquisition of mortars, howitzers, gunship, rocket launchers or other large artillery but machine guns, bazookas hand grenades, gun-trucks, operational vehicles and such other light weapons that enhance the effectiveness of the infantryman.
The position of the infantry soldiers in the battlefield has remained one of utmost significance even as scientific breakthrough and technological innovations have revolutionized military weaponry over the ages. From the use of dagger, sword, tomahawk, spear along with bow and arrow as the main weapon of war in earlier times to the discovery of gunpowder in the medieval era down to the emergence of the nuclear weapon in the modern times, the foot soldier remained ever relevant and crucial in the prosecution of war. The military authorities in Nigeria should place emphasis on enhancing the operational capability of the infantryman in the war against terrorism as this will yield greater result than the procurement of heavy military hardware which has the danger of falling into the hands of the insurgent and further compounding an already worse situation. Besides, there is the need to minimize collateral damage in the battlefield.
The infantryman's kit should consist of a machine gun that is fed with cartridges rolling continuously from a belt worn across the shoulders in place of the outdated mark4 rifle fed by a large magazine still in use used by Nigerian soldiers. Alternatively, ballistic experts have recommended the M16 Automatic Rifle with its small magazine that holds 20-30 rounds as having similar firepower as the light machine gun and uses the same 5.56mm ammunition. In a normal full-fledged armed duel, the infantry weapon is complemented by large artillery and air strikes.
It was this strategy of according priority to the infantryman adopted by Communist China that brought the Korean War [1950-53] to an end. The war had proved intractable as it had been raging fiercely among the enemies; first with North Korea having the upper hand, a state of affairs that was reversed upon the involvement of the US on the side of South Korea and thus overturning the course of the war. But when China, the nation reputed as having the largest army globally entered the hostilities ostensibly to prevent the North Koreans from being pushed over its border, but actually for ideological reasons, the other rivals were overwhelmed by the share number of Chinese soldiers swarming the entire landscape. This approach consequently brought hostility to an end with neither side being proclaimed as the victor nor the vanquished.
If given the necessary counterinsurgency training, modern weapons and other up-to-date operational equipment as well as relevant morale boosting incentives, the infantryman holds the ace in the war against terrorism in Nigeria.

25 September 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"25 September 2014 14:44 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2014 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Sep 25, 2014 (SAnews.gov.za/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- President Jacob Zuma used his speech delivered at the UN General Assembly on Wednesday night to rally the world behind South Africa's campaign to transform the United Nations Security Council and for Africa to have permanent seats in the council.
The UNSC comprises 15 members, five of them - Britain, France, China, the United States and Russia - are permanent, while 10 are non-permanent members that serve for two years on a rotational basis without veto power. South Africa has been calling for this to change.
""Let me reiterate that the 70th anniversary of the UN next year provides an opportunity for us to seriously reflect on the need to reform this august body, moving beyond words to action.
""Ten years ago, world leaders celebrating the 60th anniversary of the UN agreed on the need for reform of the United Nations Security Council in particular,"" President Zuma said to rumbling applause.
In a loud and clear message to the more than 120 leaders, who converged at the UN Headquarters for the UNGA General Debate, President Zuma said the UN can no longer afford to have Africa out of the UNSC on a permanent basis.
""When we converge here next year, on the 70th year of the UN, we should be able to adopt a concrete programme that will guide us towards a strengthened UN and a reformed Security Council.""
President Zuma said some ""contentious aspects"" of the UN system, such as the veto powers and the exclusion of regions such as Africa in the Security Council, were some of the critical matters that cannot be ignored in the quest for transformation.
The UNSC is the UN's most powerful body. It helps to shape international law and is the first to respond to crises. This places Africa in a precarious position, considering that most issues the council has to deal with emanate from the continent.
Millennium Development Goals
Apart from the call to reform the UN, President Zuma's remarks, as anticipated, focused on the progress South Africa has made in attaining its Millennium Development Goals (MGDs), whose deadline of September next year looms larger.
""South Africa has recorded impressive progress through the expansion of health infrastructure and improved access to health services for all South Africans,"" President Zuma said.
""On the reduction of child mortality, MDG 4, and the improvement of maternal health, MDG 5, significant progress has been recorded, but more work remains. In fact, more work remains worldwide to fully achieve these goals, especially in the developing world,"" he said.
He said Africa had to confront those underlying root causes that continued to make it impossible for its people to have a better life.
Despite the progress that the continent has made, reports continued to show that Africa is lagging behind in terms of the attainment of some of the MDGs.
""It is for this reason that we appreciate the crafting of a post-2015 Global Development Agenda that will carry forward the unfinished business of the MDGs. The eight MDGs were adopted by the UN in 2000 and set clear targets in improving conditions in a wide range of areas, including halving extreme poverty rates to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS.  

""The General Assembly has proposals to replace the MDGs with what is being referred to as the new Sustainable Development Goals, which outline 17 goals and 169 targets. This is part of the UN's post-2015 development agenda, which aims to carry forward the work of the MDGs that have just eight goals and 21 targets.""
President Zuma said the post-2015 Global Development Agenda ""will provide a frame of reference for our collective agreement on what has to be done"".
""We reiterate that developed countries should be reliable partners and meet their commitment to development goals, such as contributing 0.7% of their gross national income towards Official Development Assistance,"" he asserted.
Ebola
President Zuma further said the recent outbreak of Ebola, which has claimed more than 2 000 lives in some West African countries, was one example of the challenges that developing countries continue to contend with.
""We believe that Ebola would have been contained within a few days had it been an outbreak in the developed world. But it has become a pandemic that threatens the economies of affected African States.""
The outbreak had exposed the challenges of capacity, lack of infrastructure and other limited resources in Africa, he said.
South Africa would continue to provide resources to assist the people and governments of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone to contain the virus.
The Palestine question
President Zuma said while the UN has done remarkably well in supporting self-determination, the world body has been found wanting by the people of Palestine. Israel and Palestine have been involved in a territorial dispute stretching over decades and claiming thousands of lives during this period.
President Zuma said the UN needed to intervene on the issue of Palestine ""without fear or favour"". He said the Israeli-Palestine question was one of the oldest items on the UN agenda ""but progress remains elusive"".
""In the past few months in particular, the world has witnessed a devastating conflict that left a humanitarian crisis of shocking proportions.
""The people of Palestine were left homeless, with no medical facilities, no safe drinking water, bereaved and having to care for the wounded after a trail of destructive military actions by Israel. South Africa has condemned the actions of both Israel and Hamas, and we have called for an immediate cessation of hostilities.""
President Zuma said there can be no military solution to the Israeli-Palestinian question, in clear reference to the military attacks the Israel government has unleashed on Palestine in recent months.
""We should all remain committed to the two-state solution based on the 1967 borders with Palestine and Israel co-existing side by side in peace. Of concern in this matter has been the helplessness displayed by the UN, especially the UN Security Council, during the current conflict.""
South Africa would also continue to contribute to finding solutions to the conflicts in Sudan.
""The recent developments and the ongoing conflict in South Sudan have resulted in loss of life and dire humanitarian consequences. South Sudan should not be allowed to regress,"" said President Zuma. SAnews.gov.za","President Zuma - We Need a Reformed UN

Monrovia, Sep 23, 2014 (FrontPageAfrica/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- She no longer commands an artillery unit or security operations at the Roberts International Airport but far away from her homeland, Liberia, Martina Johnson's hideout was exposed after authorities in Gent, Belgium picked her up last week.
Johnson, a former front line Commander of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) of Charles Taylor was arrested and indicted by a Belgian Judge for her direct implication in alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity including mutilation and mass killing committed in Liberia during the civil war in 1990. More importantly, sources closed to the effort to nab Johnson told FrontPageAfrica that Johnson's arrest and detention could finally solve the mystery surrounding the killing of five American nuns during the now- infamous Octopus raid in October 1990.
Operation Octopus began on Oct. 15, 1992, when Taylor's forces attacked positions of a West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG. The assault was led by intoxicated boys and teenagers who were unpaid, but were given permission to loot Monrovia, according to Human Rights Watch.
The five nuns were engaged in humanitarian work in Liberia when they were murdered by rebels believed to have belonged to the NPFL. They were members of the Adorers of the Blood of Christ and had been missing for more than a week prior to the shooting. Four student Liberian nuns were also killed along with the American sisters, according to the Vatican at the time. On Monday, Cheryl Wittenauer Communications Director, for the Adorers of the Blood of Christ in St. Louis, Missouri said the organization would not be making any comment at this time regarding the new development.
The nuns were caught in the middle of fighting near Gardnersville after the NPFL launched a new offensive on Oct. 15. ""The safety and welfare of the wounded and the defenseless motivated them and were their only concerns in the midst of war,"" U.S. Ambassador to Liberia William H. Twaddell said in a message to the sisters' headquarters at the time. The late Archbishop Michael K. Francis at the time said the nuns were shot in two separate incidents. Two were killed on a roadside, and three died in front of the convent where they had remained to tend to war victims and orphans. Their bodies were never recovered.
The slain missionaries were Sister Barbara Ann Muttra, a nurse from Springfield, Ill., who first went to Liberia in 1971; Sister Agnes Mueller, a nurse and a teacher of Bartelso, Ill.; Sister Kathleen McGuire, a teacher from Ridgway, Ill.; and Sisters Shirley and Mary Joel Kolmer, first cousins and teachers from Waterloo, Ill. The nuns, who were committed to helping Liberians that they returned to Monrovia in mid-1991 after fleeing the violence there in 1990, worked at a compound in Gardnersville, a suburb of Monrovia, according to the headquarters of the order in Red Bud, Ill.
Sister Mildred Gross, head of the order, told the Washington Post at the time that the missionaries, all in their 50s and 60s, ""actually wanted to go back because they felt very committed to the mission of the church and the people."" She had last spoken to the women by telephone on Oct. 2. The area was reportedly under the control of Johnson, whose forces were responsible for manning the posts.
Taylor denied on numerous occasions that his troops were responsible for the killings. He even made a special broadcast in the killings aftermath in which he stated that it was not clear what happened to the nuns and insisted that his forces did not control the area around their convent. ""It is really no-man's-land, so it is anybody's guess what has happened to those nuns,"" he said at the time.
He would tell prosecutors at his war crimes trial, almost a decade later that the matter was investigated when it happened but nothing materialized. ""The Government of the United States raised that issue, we had it investigated and it remained an issue today that was determined that actually it could not be said with any certainty that the NPFL killed those nuns. ""They died in crossfire and that's the information that was circulated between the Government of the United States and I will like to see anything to the contrary,"" Taylor told the court
 

The killings were slammed as cowardice by the U.S. State Department at the time, which expressed shock and by the deaths as pressure mounted on all factions to engage in an immediate cease-fire and to ""resume serious negotiations to end the civil war.""
Johnson's arrest marks the first time an alleged Liberian perpetrator has been criminally charged for crimes under international law committed in Liberia during the first civil war. The investigation and arrest was possible under Belgian law as Martina Johnson lives in Belgium. It is the first arrest ever for war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed during the 1st Liberian civil war (1989-1996)
Civitas Maxima who has been working since 2012 with the Global Justice and Research Project (GJRP) based in Monrovia to document crimes committed during the war and find avenues for criminal accountability wrote and filed a criminal complaint against Martina Johnson on behalf of 3 Liberian victims in 2012.
The complaint says Liberian victims implicated Johnson as having participated directly in mutilation and mass killing in late 1992 during the ""Operation Octopus"", an infamous military offensive by the NPFL of Charles Taylor on the capital Monrovia that left scores of civilians dead. Many civilians were targeted because of their affiliation to certain ethnic groups, including the Mandingos and the Krahns perceived as antithetical to the NPFL's interests.
Investigators say the arrest signals an important phase in ending impunity in Liberia.
In Sierra Leone, a Special Court was established as a result of the 1999 Lome' Peace Agreement. This agreement established the framework for a Special Court and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The 1993 Accra Peace Agreement for Liberia did not contain provision for a Special Court, but rather the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The report of the Liberia TRC has been controversial and implementation has been virtually absent.
However, legal experts say, international law provides and various countries have accepted obligations to prosecute individuals who are alleged to have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity to face prosecution wherever they are found. There should be no hiding place for such violators.
Several countries like the United States, Belgium, the Netherlands and many others have spared no efforts in fulfilling these obligations under international law. The US Government recently enforced sanctions against key government officials of the Liberian Government denying entry in the United States.
The Netherlands, a few years ago, arrested and tried Gus Kouvehouven, the former owner of hotel Africa. Belgium pursued some Congolese and it appears that this is increasingly becoming the trend internationally.
FrontPageAfrica recently reported that the United States Head of Global Crimes and Justice, Stephen Rapp, was traveling around marshaling support in this area. Liberian has witnessed the arrest of Mr. Tom Woewiyu, for Defense Spokesman of the NPFL.
Key Witness Holds Key
The arrest of Martina Johnson seems to have sent shock waves in many quarters indicating the seriousness attached to the new mission of international criminal justice. The cost of establishing national institutions like the Special Court on Sierra Leone and the limited result is convincing that domestic legal systems could be better suited and less expensive to deal with such issues.
Johnson was reportedly arrested in Belgium after a period of evidence gathering. There are reports that the evidence is extensive ranging from operations Octopus when the five Catholic Nuns were killed in the Barnesville Area to the killing a Dutch National who was also killed during that period. There are reports that the investigation concerning the nuns was discontinued because a key witness under protection has abandoned this status.
However, the case was reactivated along with several other cases. There are also indications that some looted items have been discovered in the possession of some individuals who were allegedly involved with the killing of the nuns and the Dutch lady.
Investigator say there seems to be no hiding place for those who think they escaped justice for crimes committed in Liberia. ""With the lack of clarity surrounding the mission of the US Team in Liberia, one might not know whether such mandate could extend to the arrest and transport of alleged war criminals,"" a source closed to the investigation told FPA Monday.","War Crimes Arrest May Solve American Nuns Death Mystery

Sep 22, 2014 (Vanguard/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- I read with interest Asari Dokubo's comments published on September 14 in the Daily Post.
Asari is quite correct in saying that he knows me well and has met members of my family. In 2004, the Niger Delta was aflame with conflict. Asari, Ateke Tom and Tompolo were waging a fierce war against the Nigerian federal and state governments. Many people had been killed.
Nigerian military were having trouble contending with Asari's guerrilla warfare. Small, highly mobile and heavily armed militant forces in fast boats struck across the Niger Delta targeting oil installations and military posts. Nigeria's oil output at one point dropped to as low as 600,000 barrels per day and on average was halved to one million barrels per day.
Australian negotiator, Dr. Stephen Davis, and Boko Haram commanders in 2013 after BH reportedly agreed to dialogue
This was a devastating blow to Nigeria's economy and the operations of the major international oil companies. Apart from the economic impact, communities were suffering from the conflict with many innocent people killed in military efforts to purge the communities of militants.
My wife and I were living in Port Harcourt and, in 2004, I explored the idea of a peace deal with an Ijaw friend, Von Kemedi. As an Ijaw, he knew Asari who was also Ijaw. Von was able to make contact with Asari who agreed to meet with me.
Von and I subsequently travelled through the swamps in a speed boat to Opurata village to see the damage to villages before transferring to a canoe that we paddled to another village from where we were met by Asari's men in another fast boat. With a blindfold on we were taken to another island where we waited until another boat escorted us to Asari's camp. A vigorous discussion took place that night surrounded by Asari's well-armed fighters. By the end of the night, the foundation of a peace deal has been set down.
I subsequently took the peace proposal to President Olusegun Obasanjo and found him ready and willing to support peace and disarmament. The deal also encompassed demobilisation and a programme to reintegrate the militants back into the communities. This required a skills training programme which President Obasanjo supported. A final essential element was weapons surrender and destruction. The protocol used was that set down by the UN and was agreed by both sides.
At the Villa
I stayed in close contact with Asari by satellite phone each evening around 5pm. We worked out the details of the peace process. The first step was a ceasefire. The ceasefire was set in place on September 8, 2004, but in the following days was broken three times and each time it was the Nigerian military that broke the ceasefire. Even when under fire during a ceasefire breach Asari, honoured his word and withdrew, firing only for self-protection.
To complete the peace deal, President Obasanjo directed me to oversee the extraction of Asari and his key commanders in September 2004. I travelled to the Niger Delta with a handful of SSS men headed by Fubara Duke, an Ijaw man known to Asari and trusted by President Obasanjo.
At 1am on September 29, 2004 Asari, and his commanders met us at Abonnema Landing in the Niger Delta and we proceeded to Port Harcourt airport where we boarded a plane at dawn to take us to Abuja and direct to President Obasanjo in the Cabinet Room. That day was punctuated with amazing revelations as Asari recounted events that led him and his men to defy the government and launch a guerrilla style campaign.
 

Asari always kept his word to me. He gave me an undertaking on the ceasefire and kept it even in the face of breaches by the military. When it came to time for weapons surrender, he asked me how many weapons I wanted him to surrender. I said, ' Asari you have 3,000 men, so I want 3,000 weapons.'
Asari gave a commitment to hand over 3,000 guns, 100 general purpose machine guns and some rocket launchers which were subsequently destroyed in a series of public destructions to UN standards overseen by the Army at Bori Military Camp in Port Harcourt in mid-November 2004.
President Obasanjo kept his word and on October 1, 2004 the peace accord was announced and Asari and his commanders returned to the Niger Delta.
Asari is correct is saying I never paid him anything. I never paid anyone and no one paid me either by way of funds or favours. President Obasanjo did not offer to pay me for the Niger Delta peace accord and I did not seek payment. The peace deal was built on trust. I went to Asari's camp unarmed and without any security.
Asari and his key commanders travelled with me and the small SSS contingent totally unarmed. We trusted each other with our lives and that built trust. There can be no peace without trust. Without trust, there is merely a ceasefire which will eventually be broken and the fighting resume.
Asari said in his interview with the Daily Post that President Obasanjo broke his word. I am not so sure of that. What I think Asari may be referring to is the demobilisation and skills training that did not materialise after the peace accord. Funds were to be set aside to train the ex-militants for employment and to reintegrate them back into their communities. This phase of the work was to be undertaken by the state governors.
By March 2005, a full six months had passed without any sign of training and reintegration. It was no surprise then to find 200 Niger Delta ex-militants had been recruited by foreign mercenaries to participate in a coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea. The ex-militants were intercepted as they departed Warri in a ship bound for Guinea. They had each been promised $5,000 and an AK47.
Had the promised skills training and reintegration been implemented, these young men probably would not have agreed to join the coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea. So Asari is right but it was more likely that the governors were not sincere and not former President Obasanjo. It was the governors that had armed, promoted and used the gangs for political purposes in much the same way that former Governor Modu Sheriff was alleged to have done in Borno State..
It was this failure to honour the agreement to demobilise by providing skills training and reintegration that fuelled discontent and provided the conditions that formed MEND which added bombing and kidnapping to its mode of operation.
Contrary to Asari's understanding, former President Obasanjo did not bring me to Nigeria on my recent trip to seek the release of the Chibok girls or for any other purpose. Nor did President Jonathan or anyone else. I came to Nigeria in April this year to seek the release of the Chibok girls at my own expense and of my own volition because I could see no progress on the release of the kidnapped girls.
Girls horrifying rape
While Asari may not believe any girls were kidnapped, let me assure you that hearing the stories of some girls who have escaped from Boko Haram camps is a sobering experience. There are many girls who have been kidnapped apart from the girls from the Chibok school.
The kidnapping of girls by Boko Haram has been going on for at least a year. Initially Boko Haram kidnapped girls because the fighters could not go back home to their wives. They used the kidnapped girls. Girls tell how they were raped every day, week after week.
One girl was raped every day, sometimes several times a day by groups of men. Some did not survive the ordeal. The escaped girls tell harrowing stories of rape and abuse. They are traumatised and require medical treatment and counselling. These girls are testament to the horrifying truth about the kidnappings.
Dokubo-Asari
But the Chibok kidnappings were only the start of my recent journey to Nigeria. It soon became apparent the (alleged) sponsors did not want any interference in their plan. The ""political Boko Haram"" which (allegedly) started out as Sheriff's ECOMOG (so named after the military peace keeping forces operating in Liberia at that time because an SDP - Social Democratic Party- candidate was protected from an angry mob in Bama by a group of youths supporting the SDP) that targeted his political opponents in the 2003 and 2007 elections have since mutated into the Boko Haram we see today that terrorises through beheadings, butchering innocent villagers, bombing innocent people at shopping malls and in churches, raping and kidnapping.
 

It is true that Sheriff fell-out with Yusuf and the allegation stands that when the military captured Yusuf in late July 2009 and handed him over to the police in Borno State, he was allegedly executed on Sheriff's instruction. Thus the root of the perception that Sheriff cannot be a sponsor but a hated enemy of Boko Haram. But the core of the old Yusufiya is no longer part of Boko Haram. Boko Haram is a mutation of political Boko Haram and Shekau's Ansaru. The Yusufiya grew out of the Izala movement and had great respect for Izala. Boko Haram now beheads Izala followers. The ""slaughterers"" work with the political assassins and suicide bombers. The sponsors of Boko Haram do not care how many innocent Nigerians are slaughtered, how many women are raped, how many girls and boys are kidnapped, how many villages are plundered. I have met too many victims to say, ""It is not my problem"". We are each diminished if we allow such crimes against our fellow citizens to persist. The Nigerian military is diminished if it uses Boko Haram tactics to address the problem. Evil will flourish and triumph if good men and women do nothing. Many Nigerian politicians have said little and done nothing to curb the slaughter of Nigerians that is being supported by the sponsors. While fathers die to protect their daughters and wives are raped and butchered the sponsors of Boko Haram are accorded privileges and protection. They fly in private jets and are accorded military protection. Are the sponsors of Boko Haram so far above the law? Have the citizens of Nigeria lost the right to bring these men to justice? Who will stand up for the poor and oppressed who are being slaughtered and raped in their hundreds? By the grace of God we trust that good men and women will stand up and justice will prevail.

19 September 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"19 September 2014 13:24 All Africa AFNWS English (c) 2014 AllAfrica, All Rights Reserved Sep 19, 2014 (The NEWS/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- Liberia's acting Minister of Finance and Development Planning has underscored government's ardent commitment to making Liberia Ebola free as the World Bank boosts the country's effort when it approved a $52 million grant for Liberia to eradicate the deadly virus, Wednesday.
Liberia's Ambassador to the United States Jeremiah Sulunteh signed on behalf of the government in Washington, D.C. while the Bank's Vice President Mahktar Diop signed for the Bank. Two of the worst affected countries, Guinea and Sierra Leone were represented at the signing ceremony.
Mr. Amara Konneh who witnessed the ceremony live via video conference from the World Bank office in Congo Town, Monrovia, was elated as he thanked the World Bank for breathing fresh life in government's unwavering commitment to fight the deadly virus which has claimed hundreds of lives in the country since the outbreak last March.
Disclosing that Liberia needs about $200 million to eradicate the virus, Minister Konneh said the new World Bank grant money would be used in three categories including support to the health system by improving various health facilities across the country, investing in the health workers who are risking their lives on a daily basis and providing food and basic services to various quarantined centers around the country.
Minister Konneh lamented that the Ebola epidemic has seriously affected the economic sector, particularly the mining and agriculture sectors. ""For Liberia this epidemic is creating a lots of set-backs for our development agenda, our economy will decline by 3.5 percent this fiscal year which will affect job creation and the livelihood of our citizens,"" hinted Minister Konneh.
Ambassador Sulunteh expressed gratitude to the World Bank Group for the timely help and assured the Bank that the grant will significantly change the result of the battle against the deadly Ebola disease in Liberia. ""The situation in Liberia is more than a civil war, because in a civil war one can call for ceasefire and talk to various parties involved, but with Ebola there is no ceasefire.""
The World Bank Group's (WBG) Board of Executive Directors approved a US$105 million grant to finance Ebola-containment efforts underway in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, help families and communities cope with the economic impact of the crisis, and rebuild and strengthen essential public health systems in the three worst-affected countries to guard against future disease outbreaks.
The new grant is part of the US$200 million Ebola emergency mobilization first announced by the WBG in early August. The WBG said its new Ebola Emergency Response project mobilized US$52 million for Liberia, the country with the highest number of Ebola infections, US$28 million for Sierra Leone, and US$25 million for Guinea.
The allocations were calculated according to the World Health Organization's Roadmap and assessments of the relative severity of the epidemic in each country.
The WBG said it would almost certainly mobilize more financing for the countries since ""the immediate response is still significantly under-resourced for the purposes of curbing the outbreak.""
Up to 40% of the new grant, which is financed by the WB's IDA Crisis Response Window that normally helps poor countries recover from severe natural disasters or economic crises, could also be used for retroactive financing of eligible Ebola containment efforts in the three worst-affected countries.",World Bank's U.S.$52 Million Boosts Liberia's Fight Against Ebola,All Africa AFNWS English

AS DELIVERED
Remarks by Ambassador Samantha Power, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, at a Stakeout Following a Security Council Session on Libya and Liberia, September 15, 2014
Good afternoon. Members of the Security Council just received a briefing from Special Representative Leon on the situation in Libya and the UN's efforts to secure an immediate and durable negotiated ceasefire. I'd like to start by reading out press elements agreed to by all members of the Security Council in consultation today.
Members of the Security Council express their grave concern about the current political crisis and ongoing violence in Libya.
Members of the Security Council strongly support SRSG Leon's effort to foster an inclusive political dialogue and bring an end to violence. It is critical that the entire international community support this process, and refrain from any steps, including supporting actors inside Libya, which would undermine these efforts, especially through the illicit transfer of weapons or other support to armed groups.
Members of the Security Council reiterate their call to end the violence immediately and enable the continuation of the political transition, particularly through a ceasefire in the Werfashana area, as well as in Benghazi and other parts of the country.
Members of the Security Council also reiterate their support for legitimate constitutional institutions.
Resolution 2174 is vital to the effective implementation of the arms embargo, and it makes clear the Council will take action against individuals or entities that threaten Libya's peace and stability.
The Council members also condemned any attempts to illicitly export oil per resolution 2146.
Members of the Security Council are also concerned about the harsh toll the crisis has taken on civilians, with around 300,000 who are displaced or have fled the country due to the violence. We support the efforts of the UN humanitarian agencies which are now assisting the displaced and conflict-affected populations. Members of the Security Council commend Libya's neighbors for welcoming those seeking refuge and call on all countries in the region to maintain open borders for all those in need.
They also stress the importance that all parties respect and protect the human rights of all Libyans, and express their concern about the conditions of migrants and foreigners in Libya and any violation of their human rights.
In my national capacity, let me just say that the United States is very concerned about the ongoing violence and political instability in Libya, and let me stress that the parties need to engage in dialogue and a political solution is the only way forward. We are fully supportive of SRSG Leon and his efforts to forge a political dialogue and help end the violence, especially through a ceasefire in the Wershafana area.
 

Also, the international community must be supportive of these efforts. We are concerned about the harsh toll the crisis has taken on civilians, with more than 250,000 displaced or fleeing the country due to the violence.
Libyans also suffer shortages in food, fuel, water, electricity and they face an alarming rise in crime. We are in constant communication with UN humanitarian agencies, which are assisting displaced and conflict-affected populations. We commend Libya's neighbors for welcoming those seeking refuge and call on all countries in the region to maintain open borders for all those in need.
Now, I'd just like to touch on a couple other issues before opening it up.
First, today is an important day for the people of the Central African Republic, as the new UN peacekeeping mission, MINUSCA, formally takes over responsibility for the protection of civilians. This transition represents an opportunity to make further progress in ending the violence plaguing the country and helping Central Africans translate their desire for change into positive action.
We welcome the standing up of MINUSCA and affirm our support for the operation. We also deeply appreciate the courage and sacrifice of the AU troops as well as the French and European Union forces, all of whom have been critical to the peacebuilding efforts that have led to today.
Today's transition is the next step in what must be a deepening commitment to protecting civilians, facilitating humanitarian assistance, and supporting an inclusive democratic political transition that includes holding to account those who have committed gross violations of human rights. Success depends, in part, on MINUSCA operating at its full, authorized troop complement.
We call on the United Nations to redouble efforts to ensure the full deployment of MINUSCA's military, police, and civilian staff as quickly as possible, and ensure the mission has the adequate equipment and transportation it needs to carry out its mandate. We thank those countries that have provided troops and police to MINUSCA.
Finally, members of the Security Council, as you saw, adopted a three-month technical rollover of the UNMIL mandate, which will give us some time to assess the difficult situation in Liberia.
As you know, Liberia is one of three West African countries ravaged by the recent and growing Ebola outbreak. I won't mince words. The situation on the ground is dire and growing worse by the day.
Most of you heard Special Representative Karin Landgren's account of the situation last week. The trend lines in this crisis are grave, and without immediate international action, we are facing the potential for a public health crisis that could claim lives on a scale far greater than current estimates and set the countries of West Africa back a generation.
Because of the increasingly grim situation, particularly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the United States has requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council this Thursday, September 18th.
I don't need to tell any of you how unusual Security Council debates on public health issues and public health crises are. But at this moment it is crucial that Council members discuss the status of the epidemic, confer on a coordinated international response, and begin the process of marshaling our collective resources to stop the spread of the disease.
Later this afternoon, in fact when I leave you, the United States will host a briefing for representatives on the status of the outbreak. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director, Tom Frieden, United Nations Deputy Secretary General, Jan Eliasson, and the PRs of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Nigeria will also participate in this briefing. We will try to get you all a similar briefing prior to Thursday's Council session.
This is a perilous crisis, but one that we can contain if the international community comes together to meet it head on. This outbreak is controllable, Ebola is treatable, and victims can survive.
Anything short of our full, collective commitment could have grave and destabilizing public health, humanitarian, economic, and security consequences - which could reach far beyond the borders of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
We can contain this; we know how to do it. And we must avoid panic and fear. But our collective response to date has not been sufficient. We must move forward aggressively, in a coordinated fashion, and together.
And with that I'll take a few questions.
Reporter: Thank you Madame Ambassador. First, could you tell us a little bit about the details of this emergency meeting: who's going to brief? Are you expecting some kind of an outcome document?
 

And secondly, as I'm sure you've heard, the United Nations has withdrawn a large number of peacekeepers from the Golan Heights because of the intensified fighting on the Syrian side. This has led to speculation that this mission might end, that the Council might change the mandate. Can you address that?
Ambassador Power: Thank you. First, on the Ebola session. Right now it is scheduled for 2:45 p.m. on Thursday. The Secretary General is going to brief on this urgent crisis, along with, we think, Margaret Chan of the WHO and David Nabarro, the Special Envoy. We are also hoping to bring into the Council, as we generally seek to do in our presidency, voices - or at least a voice - from the field so we really hear directly from the people who are being most affected by this crisis. And I hope to have more specifics on that for you within the next day.
All of the ambassadors from the affected countries, of course, have expressed their great desire to speak in order to appeal to the international community to come to their rescue. And we have asked that this be an open debate and that countries who are part of the UN community come to this session with an eye to making very concrete commitments in their presentations.
I say that because it would be very easy to have all the member states of the United Nations come to the Security Council and lament the tragedy of Ebola, but that is not going to get us where we need to get. We cannot admire this problem. It is too devastating for too many already and the risk of spread and exponential increase of infections is too great.
So we are looking for concrete commitments. President Obama is traveling to the CDC tomorrow. You will hear more from him. But we are asking every country in advance of this session, on behalf, again, of our friends in the region to dig deep and see what they can mobilize in short order to help respond to this crisis.
On UNDOF, I'm aware of the reports - I've seen the same reports you have. Would only take this occasion to urge all parties to respect the mission of UNDOF, the personnel, the equipment, and of course, we condemn any overrunning of UNDOF facilities. We understand the measure of pulling back is temporary, and we would also urge UNDOF to reoccupy those positions as soon as that becomes feasible.
Reporter: Ambassador, a question for you to answer in your national capacity. The administration's been very clear that there will be no coordination with the Assad regime should there be airstrikes, et cetera, taking place.
And also the administration has been very clear that any action will have international legal basis. Now, considering that if you are not coordinating with the government, what kind of basis would that be? Does that require a Security Council resolution, where based on a recommendation by the Secretary General under article 51 would suffice? Can you elaborate?
Ambassador Power: Because no military action against ISIL in Syria has been taken, I'm not going to speculate on the legal basis. I would only come back to points that you've heard me make before, and I think which are well known, which is the widespread support for anti-ISIL operations around the world, the large number of contributions, whether the military kind, in terms of humanitarian support, in terms of military equipment and resupply for the Iraqis and the Kurds.
And I would refer you to Prime Minister Abadi's statement last week, where he also made clear his belief that dealing with ISIL only in Iraq is going to be insufficient to neutralizing this threat and insufficient to Iraq being able to ensure the security and the welfare of their people.
So, you heard the president last week talk about the fact that ISIL cannot be allowed a safe area. You've heard the Iraqis, again, appeal for action that deals with ISIL in its totality. But I'm not going to get ahead of the United States government in terms of where we are on next steps.
And apologies, I'm actually running to the CDC briefing or I would, I would stay longer. Thank you.","Amb. Power's Remarks to Press On Libya, Liberia [document]",All Africa AFNWS English 
15 September 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"15 September 2014 19:12 Xinhua News Agency XNEWS English Copyright 2014. Xinhua News Agency. All rights reserved. UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council on Monday extended in a resolution unanimously adopted here the mandate of the UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) for three more months until Dec. 31, 2014. The current mandate of the UNMIL will expire on Sept. 30. In the resolution, the 15-nation body said it would discuss UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's proposals regarding adjustments to the UNMIL's mandate and intend to further extend the mandate to Sept. 30, 2015 after that. The proposals, published on Aug.15, recommended maintaining the drawdown schedule for the mission and adding electoral assistance capacity for elections in the West African country. The military drawdown will be conducted in three phases between August 2012 and July 2015, leaving UNMIL's military strength at approximately 3, 750 personnel in the end. In the resolution, the Council members also expressed grave concern about the extent of the outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa, in particular in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. They urged the international community to respond swiftly to the shortage of qualified medical professionals and appropriate equipment and preventive measures necessary to address the Ebola outbreak in the region. UNMIL was set up in 2003 to bolster a ceasefire agreement after a civil war killed almost 150,000 Liberians -- mostly civilians -- and forced some 850,000 others to flee to neighboring countries. The mission currently keeps 4,619 military personnel in Liberia. Enditem 01",UN Security Council renews mission's mandate in Liberia PeiLei,Xinhua News Agency XNEWS English Copyright

Cameron, Obama condemn IS killing of British aid workerThe Islamic State on Saturday released a video showing the beheading of British aid worker David Haines, who was abducted in Syria last year. The video comes after the murders of two American journalists by the militant group, both carried out in similar manner. The video also included a threat to kill another British hostage. Haines' murder was condemned by the British Prime Minister David Cameron, who vowed to intensify efforts to destroy IS. US President Barack Obama pledged to work together with the UK government to ""degrade and destroy"" the extremist faction.
Ukraine PM lashes out against Russia's Putin
Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk accused Russian president Vladimir Putin of threatening Europe's security through his country's alleged involvement in the separatist movement in eastern Ukraine. Yatsenyuk claimed Putin would not stop at Crimea, which Moscow annexed in March, and would work to controlling the whole of Ukraine. He added that Ukraine's membership to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was the only way his country could defend itself. His comments came as fighting erupted near an airport in eastern Ukraine on Saturday despite the recent ceasefire.
Liberia asks US for help to fight Ebola
Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf appealed to US President Barack Obama for immediate help in tackling the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Sirleaf asked for an Ebola treatment unit operated by US military teams to be set up in the capital of Monrovia. In addition to committing funds, Washington will expand medical services and train security forces in dealing with public unrest.
Pakistan arrests 100 opposition activists
Pakistani police arrested 100 anti-government protestors in an effort to crack down on demonstrations in Islamabad that began mid-August. Many protestors gathered outside a court in the capital to condemn the arrests. The protests led by cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahir ul-Qadri have been demanding that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif resign over alleged election fraud. Despite negotiations between both sides, the political stalemate continues.
Uganda thwarts al-Shabab attack
Ugandan security forces on Saturday claimed to have discovered an al-Shabab terrorist cell in the capital Kampala, where the group appeared to have been planning a terror attack. The police have made several arrests and increased security in public places. Last week, the US embassy warned of possible revenge attacks by al-Shabab fighters, after a US airstrike killed the group's leader.","The World Islamic State beheads British aid worker, threatens to kill another hostage Scroll Staff",SCROIN English Copyright

Website Alleged to Extort
Millions From Companies
A major Chinese business news website allegedly extorted hundreds of millions of yuan from Chinese companies over about four years, according to reports in state media, as investigators probe the conduct of the country's media outlets.
The official Xinhua News Agency, citing investigators, said Wednesday that some journalists at the 21st Century Business Herald website had targeted companies preparing for initial public offerings. It said the journalists forced the companies to sign expensive advertising contracts to avoid negative news coverage.
Xinhua said the practice resulted in several hundred million yuan in such contracts, beginning from at least 2010.
The state broadcaster China Central Television put the total at 300 million yuan ($48.9 million).
The news website couldn't be reached to comment Thursday. Guangdong Twenty-First Century Media Co., a Chinese publisher of business newspapers and magazines and controller of the website, has declined to comment. Top editors of the site are among those who have been detained as part of the police probe.

UKRAINE
Shaky Cease-Fire Holds,
Even as Blasts Reported
The shaky cease-fire in southeastern Ukraine continued to hold on Thursday despite reports of sporadic shooting from both sides, but a planned exchange of prisoners was delayed, highlighting the difficulties facing the process of de-escalation. In the separatist stronghold of Donetsk, city officials reported multiple explosions overnight and into the morning, but no casualties.
In Kiev, military spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko said Ukrainian forces suffered no losses in the region over the past 24 hours, but admitted that the central government had lost control of the border with Russia from the separatist strongholds south to the coast of the Sea of Azov after rebels took over two towns.

WEST AFRICA
IMF Warns Over Ebola
The International Monetary Fund on Thursday warned the West African Ebola epidemic requires a large scale global intervention to control a crisis that is ravaging economies in the region. The IMF, the world's emergency lender, said it was in talks to boost bailouts for Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.

Washington, DC, Sep 12, 2014 (International Monetary Fund/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- MR. MURRAY: Good day, I'm William Murray from the Communications Department at the IMF, this is one of our regular biweekly press briefings. We're embargoed until 10:30 a.m. Washington time, that's 3:30 p.m. GMT. A couple of quick housekeeping items. Managing Director Christine Lagarde is currently in Tokyo. She'll give a keynote speech tomorrow at the World Assembly for Women, an international conference hosted by the Japanese Government. Subsequent to that, the Managing Director and First Deputy Managing Director, David Lipton, will attend the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governor's Meeting in Australia which is on September 18th-21st in Cairns.
In connection with the G-20 ministerial, we will be publishing what we call the G-20 surveillance note. It's titled ""Global Prospects and Policy Challenges."" It will be published just prior to the formal start of the ministerial meeting. Deputy Managing Director Naoyuki Shinohara is in Milan, Italy where today and tomorrow he is participating in the Asia Europe Meeting, ASEM, and he will then visit Angola on September 15th, 16th for meetings with the country authorities. Media relations can fill you in a little bit more on those activities.
Deputy Managing Director Min Zhu is in China today and tomorrow attending the Summer Davos. Mr. Zhu will then be in New York City on September 22nd, 23rd to attend ECOSOC, that's the UN's Economic and Social Council, where he will speak a high level dialogue on employment and decent work organized by the International Labor Organization.
Again, this is sort of precursor to the annual meetings. The analytical chapters of the World Economic Outlook and the Global Financial Stability Report will be released on September 30th and October 1st respectively. The WEO analytical chapters, will focus on the macroeconomic effects of public investment and on global imbalances.
The Global Financial Stability Report analytical chapters will focus on shadow banking and the role of corporate governance and executive pay for banks. Again, you'll get the chapters under an embargo on the press center here.
With that, let me open the floor to questions and then I'll take questions from QUESTIONER: There were some reports last week about the meeting here in DC this coming November where the Greek debt would have been discussed. Are there any signs that actually this meeting will take place?
MR. MURRAY: Thank you for the question. No, that's not true. There is no meeting in November at the IMF to discuss the Greek debt. The debt sustainability analysis is updated at each review, of course, of the Greek program and there are factors that move debt to GDP projections up and down. And we will make an updated assessment during the forthcoming review of the Greece program.
A full mission for the sixth review of the program is planned to start work in Athens in late September.
QUESTIONER: About the mission that will go back to Athens in late September as you said, do you have an exact date and if Poul Thomsen will lead the mission?
MR. MURRAY: I do not have an exact date at this time. We will update you and in terms of Poul Thomsen's participation, I also do not have information but follow up with us as we get closer to the mission launch and we'll get back to you. Let's keep it on Greece ...
QUESTIONER: You told us many times from this podium that the issue of the Greek debt will be discussed at the sixth review. As I understand this, it's going to begin at the end of the month. The Euro Group said on Monday that the debate will begin after the sixth review. What we want to hear is that are the discussions about the financing of the Greek program and about the debt, still proceeding on an orderly way as you told us before many times?
 

And what is your plan or your strategy for the Greek debt? Is there an option of those talks between you and the Europeans? Are the Europeans onboard to discuss this big problem for Greece?
MR. MURRAY: Thanks. I don't have any specific answers on all of your questions but I do want to remind you and others what we have said all along. There is an agreed framework in place for ensuring debt sustainability with Greece's European partners agreeing to provide any additional debt relief as needed to help bring Greece's debt down to 124 percent of GDP by 2020. And to substantially below 110 percent of GDP by 2022 as long as Greece continues to deliver on its program commitments.
QUESTIONER: A couple of things on Russia and Ukraine. On Russia, some people were talking earlier this year about the threat of a recession. So I -- my question is how do you assess that threat at this point? And my second one is whether you expect any missions to Russia anytime soon for a regular update.
MR. MURRAY: I'll take the recession question first and then get into the upcoming missions. The IMF projection at the end of the Article IV mission which was concluded in July showed a 0.2 percent growth for 2014 which is not a recession. We are not projecting a recession in Russia in 2014.
There is a staff visit that is planned for the second half of September and communications are planned at the conclusion of that visit. So again, there will be a mission the second half of September upcoming but you'll have to stay tuned in terms of communications from that mission.
QUESTIONER: Thank you. And on Ukraine, again, the situation is dire but they do have a ceasefire now that seems to be holding. In terms of your program, in terms of the economic prospects for the country, do you regard this as their last chance?
MR. MURRAY: Well, don't forget we've had regular reviews on the Ukraine program and there will be one coming up. So I don't really have anything fresh in terms of our findings since the last review but let me note that we do welcome the agreement reached and the fact that the ceasefire has been broadly holding.
The current assumption under the program is that the conflict will subside in the coming months and staff continues to monitor developments very closely. However, as we've noted many times, there's significant downside risks in the program and, you know, we'll be updating you on those as we progress.
QUESTIONER: Last time we had a briefing you mentioned that the IMF was working on economic assessments for the three countries that have been hit by Ebola. So I wanted to know if you had an update on that or when you expect that to be released.
MR. MURRAY: Okay, sure. Let me get to you on that. Well, beyond the human toll that this outbreak is exacting, the Ebola outbreak looks set to cause significant harm to the economies of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. A large scale and well-coordinated intervention by the international community is urgently needed to help bring the epidemic under control particularly in the cases of Sierra Leone and Liberia. The largest sectors of these already fragile economies, that's the agriculture, services and mining sectors are being affected.
This is, in turn, engendering significant financing gaps for the fiscal and external accounts of these two countries and triggering higher inflation. In Guinea where the outbreak started earlier and the number of new cases has slowed somewhat more recently, industrial mining has so far been spared but economic activity has nonetheless slowed sharply in Guinea on account of disruption to international travel and closing of land borders in Guinea.
So how bad is the situation? Well, it's evolving rapidly but based on the latest information available growth could decline by at least three to three and a half percent in Liberia and Sierra Leone and by about one and a half percent in Guinea.
The largest estimated growth impact in Liberia and Sierra Leone is attributed to the fact in both countries, as I mentioned, that industrial production is being affected while this isn't the case in Guinea so far.
QUESTIONER: And that's for 2014?
MR. MURRAY: Correct.
QUESTIONER: Just to follow up on that point of clarification. Do you mean three and a half percentage points?
MR. MURRAY: Three and a half percentage points of growth.
QUESTIONER: Okay, of growth. And then --
MR. MURRAY: Three to three and a half.  

QUESTIONER: Yeah, three to three and a half, okay, in Sierra Leone and one and a half to -- in Guinea.
MR. MURRAY: Let him finish and I'll come back to you.
QUESTIONER: You said there was significant financing gaps all -- I think the IMF has programs with all three. Are you all currently in negotiations to boost their loans? Expand their financing?
MR. MURRAY: Well, right now staff estimated, as I mentioned, significant financing gaps. And we're talking in the realm for fiscal imbalance of payment needs for the three countries; these gaps are on the order of $100 to $130 million for each country. So we're -- there's a range $100 to $130 million for each country. As was noted by one of your colleagues here, all three countries do have IMF programs. So we're in active engagement right now with the authorities to help determine how we can cover the additional financing requirement that they are facing.
QUESTIONER: Is there -- are you seeing broader economic impacts regionally with the economic fallout not just from the countries but also cross border trade, there's been flight issues. There's been, what do you call it, remittances issues. There's also et cetera. You see what I'm saying.
MR. MURRAY: Right, I see where you're going with that. Yeah, I can't quantify that for you right now. Those are all, what you just mentioned are among the things that our African Department, which is in the lead on this, is monitoring very closely and is in contact with other departments at the Fund in terms of assessing spillover effects and things of that nature.
We're also in contact with all of the international organizations both in the international financial institutions and beyond to gather information and also to assess what support's needed. But at some point in time, good questions at some point in time we'll be able and I think in fairly short order we'll be able to elaborate a bit more.
QUESTIONER: The question actually on the percentage it sort of confused me. Is it that the economy of this country is going to contract by three point five?
MR. MURRAY: The hit from current growth if -- from current growth you were expecting three to three and a half percent being trimmed in Sierra Leone and Liberia. One and a half percent from Guinea.
QUESTIONER: So what was the original? Do you have the --
MR. MURRAY: I don't have the numbers in front of me. Let me see if I can get those for you before the briefing's over.
[These figures were shared with the media at the end of the briefing: Sierra Leone: from 11.3 percent to 8 percent, Liberia: from 5.9 percent to 2.5 percent, and Guinea: from 3.5 to 2.4 percent.]
QUESTIONER: So it doesn't mean these economies are going to contract necessarily?
MR. MURRAY: Don't forget this is an evolving situation so it's not over yet. But there are high -- some of the countries had higher growth, you know, positive growth, significantly positive growth rates but it's knocking growth down significantly.
QUESTIONER: Can you -- is there any sort of timeline you're working on in terms of getting these financing gaps covered to ensure that they have the adequate resources to confront the crisis?
MR. MURRAY: We would like to move on this as quickly as possible. So but there'll be, you know, there's a process in place but it'll, you know, we're hoping to move as quickly as possible. I don't have anything further to elaborate on in terms of the timing of when we'll have further announcements but we -- I expect within fairly short order we'll have more to elaborate on.
QUESTIONER: I have a question on Scotland. I mean, in case of victory of the yes, do you think that could deal a huge blow to the British economy and do you think that an independent Scotland could be self-sufficient economically speaking? And also, I have another question on Mali. I was wondering if the IMF had resumed its cooperation with the country following the purchase of the presidential plane. Thank you.
MR. MURRAY: Okay. Let's deal with Scotland first and I'm going to look again to Mali. First of all, I do want to make the point that there is a political process underway and I really don't want to comment on the political process itself. It wouldn't be appropriate. But let me make this point and you would have seen in our Article IV staff report that we had a reference, you know, it was published. The UK Article IV staff report had a reference to the issue there.
A yes vote would raise a number of important and complicated issues that would have to be negotiated. The main immediate effect is likely to be uncertainty over the transition to potentially new and different monetary,  

financial and fiscal frameworks in Scotland. While this uncertainty could lead to negative market reactions in the short term, longer term effects would depend on the decisions being made during the transition. And I would not want to speculate on this.
In terms of monetary and financial and fiscal, right.
QUESTIONER: The IMF was -- asking if the IMF was supposed to resume its mission to Mali in September, so I was wondering if it was on its way or where were you standing?
MR. MURRAY: Okay. Well, IMF staff is currently on the ground in Bamako for reviews that are underway. The discussions are a combination of the first and second reviews.
QUESTIONER: So the audit you were asking for has been carried out in Mali in the way you were expecting?
MR. MURRAY: Well, following discovery of a number of problematic transactions which reveal weaknesses in public financial management, IMF staff and the authorities reached an agreement on remedial measures which include an audit of the transactions by the independent government auditor and tightening of the procurement code.
The authorities have begun implementing these measures and this opened the way for combining the first and the second reviews of the Fund supported program. That's all I have for that. Thanks.
I'm going to try to -- we have a few questions online. . What is the IMF's comment on the sovereign debt restructuring resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly on September 9th? The resolution cites the IMF's work on the issues in 2003.
You know we certainly take note of the UN resolution. We've obviously taken note of the UN resolution,. How it's implemented really is up to the members of the UN itself. Let me make a point here. The IMF has been working since early last year on possible reforms to strengthen the framework for addressing problems of sovereign debt distress when they arise.
We were asked by our membership to explore a market-based solution and the scope and content of this ongoing work was approved the executive board reflecting broad agreement among the IMF membership. One key point, the executive board in particular endorsed a contractual based approach that centers on the Fund's assessment of debt sustainability.
So what's been going on, just for those who have not tracked the sovereign debt work at the Fund, in May last year we started a process that's still underway of looking at the range of issues facing sovereigns and how debt is sustainable and needs to be restructured. In June, this past June, the executive board had a preliminary discussion on ideas to make the Funds lending framework more flexible so as to address problems of sovereign debt distress in a more prompt and calibrated manner.
And these would be based on the Fund's case by case determination of debt sustainability which I referred to earlier. Early next month, the IMF executive board will discuss ways to strengthen sovereign bond contracts so that the process of agreeing on a restructuring with creditors can be made more efficient and avoid the type of hold out problems we have seen in the Argentina case.
In this regard, the board asked staff to focus on contractual based approaches for more orderly and efficient restructuring of sovereign debt when needed rather than approaches based on international treaty or convention. The Fund's work in the area of sovereign debt restructuring, as I mentioned, is ongoing and will be continuing for some months. And we'll have regular updates on this.
The collective action clause discussions that are upcoming, I expect there will be a staff paper published in association with that. Back to the room.
QUESTIONER: Now, if I understand correctly you just said that there is no meeting planned very clearly.
MR. MURRAY: No meeting planned.
QUESTIONER: Did the IMF ask for one to begin with?
MR. MURRAY: Not aware of one.
QUESTIONER: Okay, now in November 2012 the Europeans pledged to support Greece as needed and that included both any fiscal gaps and any debt restructuring if needed. Would a reiteration of this pledge before the next review be enough for the IMF to move with the next review, the seventh one?
MR. MURRAY: I don't think a reiteration's necessary. As we said, there is an agreed framework in place and that's where it stands.  

MR. MURRAY: I don't think is an issue for the next -- in other words, I don't think this is the issue in the context of the next review.
QUESTIONER: I'm not talking about the sixth. I'm talking about the seventh.
MR. MURRAY: I don't think it's an issue in terms of -- we take one review at a time. So it's definitely not an issue in the context of seventh.
QUESTIONER: Okay, and what about the fiscal gap? Some Europeans have said that Greece may actually top the markets and that might actually be enough for the fiscal gap to be covered. Is the IMF comfortable that this would be possible?
MR. MURRAY: You know, in terms of getting into -- you know, the point for us is a fully financed program. It always will be. So I don't want to get into details until we conduct the next review but let's -- suffice it to say that making sure the program is proper -- efficiently and fully financed is what we care about.
QUESTIONER: Talking about fully financed, the Ukraine program review said that the program was adequately financed and said that there was a $3.4 billion gap in financing between now and the end of next year, some of that in the next 12 months. Part of that was going to be met by a planned bond issuance which has now been, I believe, delayed but there was still some financing according to the review that was still to be negotiated.
Can you say right now that the Ukraine program is fully financed?
MR. MURRAY: I don't have any specifics on the current financing arrange -- you know, we've said all along that it was important for the international community to step up and help Ukraine. So that's all I have to say about that at the moment.
QUESTIONER: So to be clear there's a difference in saying the international community says we think it's important for the international community to step up than saying yes we have commitments, we have reached all the commitments we need to ensure that the program is fully financed.
MR. MURRAY: Yeah, I don't have anything specific on the status of longer term financing to Ukraine for you at the moment. I can get back to you.
QUESTIONER: I'm sorry, I'm not talking about longer term financing. I'm talking about the 12 months fully financed requirement that the IMF rules go by. I'm just trying to verify that IMF can confidently say that the program at this point is fully financed.
MR. MURRAY: As far I know, you know, we have a program with Ukraine. So I am not aware of any other condition.
QUESTIONER : So yes?
MR. MURRAY: I'm not aware of any other condition.
QUESTIONER: So yes?
MR. MURRAY: I don't have a characterization for you right now. I'll have to get back to you.
QUESTIONER: So I have a follow-up on Greece.
MR. MURRAY: Yeah.
QUESTIONER: At the end of this year, the loan agreement between the Europeans and Greece is going to finish. It's well-known, okay?
MR. MURRAY: Uh-huh, yeah.
QUESTIONER: My question is are you comfortable to continue a loan dealing with the Greek program. That's the one. The second one thing, what is going to happen to this Troika? It's going to become just the IMF?
MR. MURRAY: I don't have anything on the Troika to elaborate upon at this time. I mean, we still have a program Greece that goes through into 2016. As far as I know, that's still the case. And, you know, we'll have to go from there.
I have to remind you that, because our program runs through until early 2016, our main focus is just to continue our work, whatever format it does it in. We still have work to do. Questions on any program with Europe are for European and Greek officials to talk about.
 

QUESTIONER: Bill, really can you take this question and maybe you can give us an answer later because it's a very important question.
MR. MURRAY: Well, you know, the thing is we have a program. We can operate in -- we operate all over with whatever structures we -- as long as we have a program, we continue to operate so that's what it is. I don't have anything to be -- it would be speculating if I had to say, you know, what ifs. We have a program. There's a review process underway. It continues. So --
QUESTIONER: So you are staying along, that's --
MR. MURRAY: Still have a program with Greece so it continues.
QUESTIONER: I have another question on Cyprus if it's possible.
MR. MURRAY: Sure, yeah, please.
QUESTIONER: I really don't know what is going on with Cyprus. There are a lot of reports that you are not going to give them the money and can you tell us what is the problem since the last 18 months, if I remember well, your reviews on Cyprus were very, very positive?
MR. MURRAY: I'm not sure about some of your characterizations, but let me tell you where things stand at the moment with Cyprus and the IMF. An IMF team with representatives of the European Commission, the ECB, the Troika that you referred to earlier, ended their visits in Nicosia to discuss the fifth review of the program back in July.
We published a statement back in July on that. I do not have an exact board date, IMF board date at the moment, and we'll communicate to you when we do have a firm date. You know, we have urged the authorities to put in place a legislative package on foreclosures that ensures that the foreclosure process is effective and provides adequate and balanced incentives to work out troubled loans.
This is essential to deal with high and rising non-performing loans, restart the flow of bank credit and put Cyprus back on the path of sustainable growth. The current package is not compatible with these goals and we look forward to hearing from the authorities on how they plan to proceed. That's my --
QUESTIONER: So I don't understand really, you're going to give them the money or not?
MR. MURRAY: We look forward to -- well, like I said, we don't have an exact date for completing the review the board and we'll communicate that when it's firm.
QUESTIONER: Yesterday, I think the board approved an extension in the 400 and some odd billion in emergency reserves for the IMF. That number has declined by about 40 billion I think since 2012 and the number of contracts. Can you say who's dropped off and why that money's still needed?
MR. MURRAY: Yeah, I'd have to chase that with our finance department. I think there's, you know, it's -- I'll have to get back to you on that. I think you're correct that it's a slightly smaller number but from an operational perspective it's not significant but I will get back to you on the countries.
Sure, no, that's fine. We'll update everybody. So the -- okay. This is -- oh, let me take a -- my colleagues are signaling. Let take some from the online media briefings that are here. Pakistan question. Please inform us when will Pakistan get the next installment of the loan which is due this month or has it been delayed?
Moreover, what kind of waiver had been given to Pakistan to qualify for the next tranche? Let
Again, this is the review process. So the fourth review discussions of our extended Fund facility are still ongoing. Discussions in Dubai have been constructive and will continue via video conference from Washington, DC. We expect to update you at the conclusion of these discussions.
Discussions, you know, always vary in terms of timing, so I can't be precise in terms of when we'll wrap up. Okay, I think we're going to take one more question from the center here Has Portugal showed any official intention to the IMF as Ireland did to an early payback of its bailout?
My answer on that is that we have not received any communication on this. So again, has Portugal showed any official intention to the IMF as Ireland did to an early payback of its bailout loans? That's the question. All I can tell you is that we have not received any communication on this.","Transcript of a Press Briefing By William Murray, Deputy Spokesman, International Monetary Fund [document]",All Africa AFNWS English

Washington, DC, Sep 12, 2014 (United States Senate/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX) -- As Delivered on the Senate floor
Mr. President, this is an uneasy time in our world. There is no shortage of crises that demand our attention and our action. The President called on us last night to step up to the very real challenge posed by the terrorist group ISIS in Iraq and in Syria. Russian aggression against Ukraine also demands our attention. A fragile cease-fire continues between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. There is the Central American exodus to our southern border that riveted the attention of many this summer, and continuing negotiations to seek an end to Iran's illicit nuclear weapons program.
But behind all of this, there is another and equally important challenge that I wanted to draw this body's attention to for a few minutes today - the spread of a quiet and vicious virus throughout West Africa.
While the nation's attention today for good reason is on remembering the tragic events of 9/11 and the President's strategy for combating ISIS today, I'd like to speak on another urgent challenge to our country and our world. That's the need for us to dramatically increase our support as communities across West Africa struggle to confront and combat Ebola.
I've met and spoken with Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Surleaf - Nobel Prize winner, an impressive leader, a woman who has brought her country back from a terrible civil war and was making huge progress toward the development of Liberia - who I've have had the honor of meeting with here and visiting there. In my role as the chairman of the African Affairs Subcommittee, I have met few others that have impressed me as much as President Johnson-Surleaf. Leaders throughout this region are doing everything they can to staunch the spread of this virus and save lives, but in my most recent communications with President Johnson-Surleaf, it is clear that Ebola is rapidly getting beyond the capacity, the ability of these communities and countries to contain it and to recover from it.
They need our action. Individuals on the ground from groups like Doctors without Borders and Samaritan's Purse have done remarkable, heroic, extraordinary work, putting their own lives on the line to help others, and they have borne the overwhelming majority of the risk, and the service, and the sacrifice so far. And news has just been announced that the Gates Foundation will contribute $50 million to this fight - critical, as public funds alone aren't going to be enough to end this crisis.
Mr. President, our own people through the United States government can and must do more. It need not be the role of the United States alone to resolve this problem, but it is our responsibility to stand side by side with those working tirelessly to stop it. It is our responsibility to not just lend a hand, but to help lead in ways that only we can, to use our unique capabilities to address this crisis.
Mr. President, if Ebola's spread reveals one thing, it's that we are more interconnected today than we have ever been in our human history, and the disease truly knows and respects no borders. We need to continue to act, not only because we are morally compelled to help the tens of thousands who are facing immediate threat, but also because we have a direct stake in the resolution of this crisis. This is a manageable public health crisis that we know how to solve, but doing so requires our focus, our attention, our resolve and our resources, tools that only the United States has.
Let me briefly outline five specific steps I believe we should take now. First, I think it's critical the United States has one leadership point - that the White House designates a coordinator to oversee the U.S. whole of government emergency response.
There are many ways the U.S. is currently helping across many agencies from the Department of Defense, to the Centers for Disease Control, to the State Department and USAID. Those agencies are doing great work as part of the disaster assistance response team on the ground. But at a time when the U.S. government is also facing and addressing crises in Iraq and Ukraine and elsewhere, I think we need one organizer, one
 

coordinator, one responsible figure addressing this crisis who is appointed by the white house to coordinate all of our resources and all of the people necessary from the U.S. government for this growing effort.
President Obama should designate an official to manage our country's response, both overseas and here in the U.S., including preparing us for the remote chance this virus might reach American soil. Our ambassadors on the ground in the three most affected countries are playing the primary role in coordination right now and they are doing remarkable work, but let me remind us in this body that in Sierra Leone, there is no currently confirmed U.S. ambassador.
The nominee, John Hoover, has been waiting almost eight months to be confirmed. Just one painful reminder that the dysfunction of this body has prevented us from confirming nominated ambassadors to dozens of countries around the world. To be effective, we need to coordinate our U.S.-based and our field-based efforts through ambassadors on the ground.
Second, we must begin to deploy U.S. military support to the maximum extent possible. Let me be clear - I don't mean combat capabilities. I mean the unique logistical capabilities of the United States military, their ability to deploy through their logistical capabilities resources that no other country can bring to bear as quickly and as successfully as we can.
I was encouraged to hear an announcement this past week from the Administration that they plan to use our military to establish a new hospital facility in Liberia, to distribute equipment, to provide infrastructure and transportation support, but I will admit I'm concerned it will take weeks to deploy.
On my visit to Liberia last August, I was struck at just how desperately poor and underdeveloped this nation of brave and inspiring people currently is, how paved roads and the ability to move at any speed rapidly ends just a few miles from the capital, and how strained the infrastructure and the public health systems are by this rapidly growing crisis.
This is not everything we can and should be doing. We need to build more field hospitals for civilians in Liberia and beyond so there are facilities for health workers and civilians fighting the disease. We also can and should provide airlift of supplies from private donors. I've heard from organizations that have worked to transport donated supplies and can fill cargo plane after cargo plane but are having difficulty getting it from here to West Africa.
We need to deepen our coordination with foreign militaries. Other nations possess similar advanced capabilities as we do and we will be able to combat this crisis more effectively if we all work together. I very much appreciate, for example, Ghana's efforts and partnership is that it allows us to use some of their facilities as an air bridge for logistics. As more air resources are poured into this fight against Ebola, we need other countries in the region t to lend a similarly open hand.
My third point is directed to our private sector, to international organizations, to the American people and to citizens of other developed nations. We need your support and your generosity and we need it now. This is a letter that Liberia's President Ellen Johnson-Surleaf sent to president Obama this week. I want to read from it briefly.
""Mr. President, as you know, the outbreak has overwhelmed the containment and treatment measures we have attempted thus far. Our already limited resources have been stretched to the breaking point, and up to now, only private charity has responded robustly in all the affected countries, but they, too, have finally reached their limit.""
My friend President Surleaf is right. It is time for the rest of us to step up. The World Health Organization has issued an Ebola response road map that calls for 10,000 additional health workers and $490 million, and we are far short of reaching these goals today. The U.S. government has contributed so far more than $100 million and has announced a commitment of another $88 million that we in this body will hopefully approve before we end this session.
The Gates Foundation, as I mentioned, has also made an impressive and incredibly generous addition of another $50 million, but the fact remains we need more. I have heard from many in my state and elsewhere across this country eager to offer support. If you have the means, I would urge you to go to usaid.gov/Ebola for links to some of the impressive nongovernmental organizations that are doing what they can on the ground to stem this humanitarian crisis.
As much as this crisis needs money and equipment and supplies, it most importantly needs nurses and doctors and paramedics and other medical professionals, thousands of them literally. The health systems of these countries - which were already among the weakest of the world - are overwhelmed, and so I'm asking today for your help. We're asking for you to save lives. If you are a trained medical professional and you're willing to help, I urge you to please go to usaid.gov/Ebola and consider how you might serve to help in this crisis.  

Fourth, we need to develop and deploy a treatment and vaccine as rapidly as possible. Here's where, in some way, America's talents and strengths in terms of the development and discovery of new treatments and of a new vaccine is a unique contribution we can make. American scientists are making progress on both fronts, but the reality is it will be hard to confront and end this disease in the long term without either. Much of the $88 million President Obama has requested from Congress will go towards this most important goal. It's critical we support that funding in this chamber on a bipartisan basis and prepare for the reality that this is only the first investment we will need to make to quickly develop and deploy these life saving drugs and these critically preventive vaccines. Lastly, Mr. President, we need to invest in the governing and economic institutions in the countries that have been so devastated by this disease. It's not a coincidence that this outbreak has emerged in countries with some of the weakest health systems on earth. Countries that face severe shortages of health care workers, labs essential for testing and diagnosis, clinics and hospitals required for treatment, and the medical supplies and protective gear, such as latex gloves and face masks, that are commonly available in the United States, but are now completely exhausted in the countries of Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia. We know how to combat this disease with isolation, good public health and burial practices, case investigation, and contact training. But all these things, all these things require trained personnel and many more resources than are currently available. In the short term, we absolutely can fill many gaps with the additional resources I've outlined, but we need to act quickly and in the long term think more deeply about why investing in local health systems and institutions in the developing world is so critical. Why a little preventive investment can go a long way to making a country more resilient in the face of a crisis like this. As we do now to stop Ebola, we need to consider the actions we can and should take together to prevent the next public health crisis. To that end, yesterday, I introduced a resolution here in the Senate with my colleagues Senators Menendez and Flake, Durbin and Corker outlining some of these very steps and recognizing the severe and real threat that the Ebola outbreak poses to West Africa - and if not properly contained - to other regions across the globe. Mr. President, here is the bottom line - we have what it takes to halt the spread of Ebola in West Africa and to save tens, if not hundreds of thousands of lives in the process. Unlike other foreign interventions, doing so will take neither bullets nor bombs, but rather, our willingness, our compassion, our generosity and our determination to act. The lives of thousands and the stability of entire countries is at stake. It is my hope and prayer that we will rise to this occasion with everything we have.",Senator Coons Calls for U.S. to do More on Ebola Crisis [document],All Africa AFNWS English

Appeals court to consider gay marriage laws in Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- For the first time since it declared California's gay marriage ban unconstitutional, the federal appeals court in San Francisco is readying to hear arguments over same-sex weddings in a political and legal climate that's vastly different than when it overturned Proposition 8 in 2012.
State and federal court judges have been striking down bans in more than a dozen states at a rapid rate since a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year.
Now, three judges on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals -- all appointed by Democrats and one whom wrote the opinion overturning Proposition 8 -- are set to hear arguments Monday on gay marriage bans in Idaho, Nevada and Hawaii.
""It seemed like such an uphill battle when I started,"" said Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights. ""I really couldn't imagine then that we would be where we are now.""
Minter has been fighting for gay marriage for 21 years, was instrumental in challenging bans in California and Utah and is representing gay couples seeking to overturn Idaho's prohibition.

Ebola experts: virus is surging in places where it was beaten back; entire countries at risk
CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) -- Doctors Without Borders shuttered one of its Ebola treatment centers in Guinea in May. They thought the deadly virus was being contained there.
The Macenta region, right on the Liberian border, had been one of the first places where the outbreak surfaced, but they hadn't seen a new case for weeks. So they packed up, leaving a handful of staff on stand-by. The outbreak was showing signs of slowing elsewhere as well.
Instead, new cases appeared across the border in Liberia and then spread across West Africa, carried by the sick and dying. Now, months later, Macenta is once again a hotspot.
The resurgence of the disease in a place where doctors thought they had it beat shows how history's largest Ebola outbreak has spun out of control.  

It began with people leaving homes in Liberia to seek better care or reunite with families back in Guinea, a pattern repeating itself all over.

Spokesman: Chick-fil-A restaurant founder S. Truett Cathy has died at age 93
ATLANTA (AP) -- S. Truett Cathy, the billionaire founder of the privately held Chick-fil-A restaurant chain that famously closes on Sundays but also drew unwanted attention on gay marriage in recent years because of his family's conservative views, died early Monday, a company spokesman said. He was 93.
Chick-fil-A spokesman Mark Baldwin told The Associated Press that Cathy died at home surrounded by members of his family. Funeral plans had not yet been finalized, he said.
Cathy opened his first postwar diner in an Atlanta suburb in 1946 and by 1967 he had founded and opened his first Chick-fil-A Inc. restaurant in Atlanta. Over ensuing decades, the chain's boneless chicken sandwich he is credited with inventing would propel Chick-fil-A expansion to more than 1,800 outlets in 39 states and the nation's capital. By early 2013, the company says on its website, annual sales topped $5 billion as the chain offered up a taste of the South that went beyond chicken to such offerings as sweet tea, biscuits and gravy.
Under the religiously conservative founder, the chain gained prominence for its Bible Belt observance of Sunday -- none of its hundreds of restaurants are open on that day, to allow employees a day of rest. Its executives often said the chain made as much money in six days as its competitors do in seven.
Those religious views helped win Cathy and his family loyal following from conservative customers, but also invited protests when Cathy's son denounced gay marriage.

Elections ahead, summer break over, Congress begins short September session with must-do items
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Summer break over and elections ahead, Congress is beginning an abbreviated September session with must-do tasks of preventing a government shutdown and extending a freeze on taxing access to the Internet.
Lawmakers will find time, too, for votes conveying political messages primed for fall campaigning.
Republicans who run the House may have lousy approval ratings, but they are poised to pad their 17-vote majority and determined to avoid mistakes like last year's partial government shutdown. That fight was over implementation of President Barack Obama's health care law.
Now, the GOP is pressing for drama-free passage of a temporary spending bill to prevent a federal shutdown at month's end and fund government agencies past the Nov. 4 election into mid-December. The Senate is sure to go along if that measure is kept free of objectionable add-ons.
House Republicans also plan votes aimed at drawing attention to legislation they say would boost jobs and energy production.

Cease-fire holds in eastern Ukraine as country's leader visits war-torn region
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- A cease-fire between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian government troops appeared to be largely holding in eastern Ukraine Monday, a day after shelling and clashes rattled nerves and imperiled the peace deal.
In a statement published online, the city council of Donetsk said there had been no reported casualties overnight and that public transport would be up and running on Tuesday. No shelling or explosions could be heard overnight in downtown Donetsk.
The regional administration of Donetsk announced that Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko would be traveling to the coastal city of Mariupol on Monday, a symbolic show of strength in a government-held city that has come under rebel fire in recent days.
The area around Mariupol had remained relatively untouched by violence until recent weeks, when rebel forces pushed toward the coastal town, shelling the city's outskirts as recently as Saturday. The city is strategically placed on the Sea of Azov coastline, raising fears that the Moscow-backed rebels could be pushing to link up mainland Russia with Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia in March.
 

The Interfax-Ukraine news agency reported Monday that 15 Ukrainian soldiers had been released by rebel forces, another key element of a peace deal between the rebels and Ukrainian troops.

China's terrorism crackdown raises concerns of excessive force, summary killings by police
BEIJING (AP) -- When attackers from China's minority Uighurs killed 37 people in a July rampage in far western Xinjiang, police responded by gunning down at least 59 of them. When three Uighurs allegedly killed a top state-appointed Muslim cleric, police shot dead two of them. When security forces led a raid on 10 suspected Uighur terrorists, they fatally shot all but one.
The incidents are part of a pattern raising concerns that Chinese police are excessively using deadly force in their bid to prevent more attacks by Uighur militants, who have killed dozens of civilians in train stations and other public places over the past few years. In some cities, patrolling SWAT units have already been authorized to shoot dead suspected terrorists without warning.
An Associated Press review of articles by China's official Xinhua News Agency and other state media has found that at least 323 people have died in Xinjiang-related violence since April last year, when the unrest began to escalate. Nearly half of those deaths were inflicted by police -- in most cases, by gunning down alleged perpetrators who are usually reported as having been armed with knives, axes and, occasionally, vaguely-defined explosives.
Beijing's tight controls and monopoly on the narrative make it difficult to independently assess if the lethal action has been justified. And Chinese authorities prevent most reporting by foreign journalists inside Xinjiang, making it nearly impossible to confirm the state media numbers. Uighur exile groups and the U.S.-government funded broadcaster Radio Free Asia report far more violent incidents than Chinese state media do, and in some cases, higher death tolls and police shootings of Uighur protesters. But those reports are similarly hard to verify.
To understand just how tough it can be to determine whether China's hand is being forced -- or whether officials are recklessly lashing out at those who resist them -- consider this recent series of confrontations in Xinjiang: On Aug. 1, police cornered a group of alleged terrorists in an abandoned house and shot nine of them dead, arresting one. In June, police gunned down 13 ""mobsters"" who allegedly attacked a local police station. In April, checkpoint police fatally shot a teenage Uighur motorcyclist after he allegedly attempted to grab their guns.

AP PHOTOS: Thousands of Gazans displaced by Hamas-Israel war still living in school shelters
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Thousands of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are still living in schools where they took refuge during seven weeks of fighting between Hamas and Israel that ended late last month.
Israeli airstrikes have left much of the territory in ruins, and thousands of homes have been destroyed or severely damaged. Reconstruction has yet to begin as a blockade imposed by Egypt and Israel on Gaza still holds, severely restricting the import of cement and other building materials.
Israel fears militants could use such materials to build rockets and reinforce cross-border attack tunnels.
With a population of 1.8 million people, Gaza is a densely populated coastal strip of urban warrens and agricultural land that still bears the scars of previous rounds of fighting. The Islamic militant group Hamas seized power in the territory in 2007.
Rebuilding Gaza will take years, and some Palestinian officials say it could cost in excess of $6 billion.

Indian, Pakistani troops help rescue people stranded by deadly flooding as rivers still rise
SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Army and air force troops on Monday worked to rescue thousands of people stranded in Indian-controlled Kashmir and northern and eastern Pakistan, where flooding and landslides have caused more than 320 deaths.
Six days of rains in Indian Kashmir have left more than 120 people dead in the region's worst flooding in more than five decades, submerging hundreds of villages and triggering landslides, officials said. In neighboring Pakistan, more than 205 people have died and thousands of homes have collapsed.
 

In Islamabad, Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority spokesman Ahmad Kamal said the death toll had risen to 205 people with at least 383 more injured over the past six days. Pakistani troops were helping civilian authorities in rescue operations and in getting aid to stranded villagers, the Pakistani army said in a statement. So far nearly 9,000 people have been evacuated from nearly 530 villagers that were inundated by flood waters, Kamal said. ___ British royal couple expecting second child; Kate being treated for morning sickness LONDON (AP) -- The Duchess of Cambridge, wife of Prince William, is expecting her second child and was being treated for severe morning sickness, royal officials said Monday.

We underestimated Gaza militants: Top army official
A SENIOR army intelligence official has admitted that Israel underestimated the tenacity of Gaza militants and did not expect a 50-day conflict, but he insisted they were soundly beaten.
The conflict, which ended with a ceasefire last week, killed more than 2100 Palestinians as well as 66 soldiers and six civilians on the Israeli side in the bloodiest battle between the Jewish state and Gaza militants for years.
""If you'd asked me two months ago, I wouldn't assess that it's going to take us 50 days,"" the official told a briefing in Tel Aviv late on Tuesday. -- AFP

Embattled airline drops the `bucket list' after disasters
MALAYSIA Airlines has changed the name of a ticket sale promotion after asking travellers which places were on their `bucket list'.
According to The Guardian, the phrase has become something of a sore point after the loss of MH370, which vanished with 239 passengers on board in March, and the MH17, which was shot down in rebellion-torn Eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 on board. A bucket list refers to things someone wants to do before ""kicking the bucket"".
The promotion has been renamed. -- The Daily Telegraph

Deadly Ebola virus is causing food shortages
THE UN said on Tuesday the spread of the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa was causing food shortages in one of the world's poorest regions and the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention warned the disease was threatening the stability of stricken countries and their neighbours.
Doctors in Liberia were out on strike as they struggled to cope with the worst outbreak of Ebola on record, while the global aid organisation, Mdecins Sans Frontires, said 800 more beds for Ebola patients were urgently needed in the Liberian capital Monrovia alone. In Sierra Leone, highly infectious bodies were rotting in the streets.
According to the World Health Organisation, Ebola has killed more than 1500 in West Africa since March. -- Reuters

Scientists produce fuel from gut bacteria, sugar
DRIVEN by the quest for an abundant, non-polluting alternative to fossil fuel, scientists said they had developed a method to produce propane using sugar and the gut bacteria E. coli.
Though the process is still far from being commercially viable, the inventors said they hoped it would one day yield a renewable source of clean fuel that could be seamlessly introduced and used by existing technologies. Propane makes up the bulk of liquid petroleum gas used in heaters, gas burners, refrigerators and some types of cars.
 

No method existed for its manufacture from a renewable source until now. -- AFP

Tokyo to target Antarctic minke whale despite ban
JAPAN plans to resume its slaughter of minke whales in the Antarctic Ocean next year, an official said yesterday, despite an order from the UN's top court to stop all whaling in the area.
Tokyo was forced to abandon its 2014-15 hunt in March when the International Court of Justice said the annual expedition was a commercial activity masquerading as research.
But a new policy announced by the government on Tuesday hopes to bypass this by giving it a more scientific focus.
Vessels would collect ""data necessary to calculate the number of whale catch allowed"", and ""construct a model of the Antarctic Ocean ecosystem"", a Japan Fisheries Agency official said. -- AFP

`Yes' vote may not be such a big change for the queen
SCOTLAND'S vote on independence this month means Queen Elizabeth faces a division in her kingdom not seen since the days of her namesake Elizabeth I at the start of the 17th century. But some things may not change so much.
Queen Elizabeth is likely to still be queen of Scotland since most Scots are keen to retain her as head of state even if they vote to go it alone.  

After almost 64 years on the throne, Elizabeth is set to overtake Queen Victoria in September next year as Britain's longest reigning monarch. But celebrations then might be muted if Scots vote for independence on September 18, although opinion polls suggest they will not. -- Reuters US Mickey Mouse, SpongeBob in road rage incident A MOTORIST in Russia captured a bizarre altercation between an angry driver and a mob dressed as SpongeBob SquarePants, Mickey Mouse and Ice Age's Scrat.

BROOKE BALDWIN, CNN ANCHOR: And staying on ISIS, President Obama vowing to destroy this group and also make them a, quote, unquote, ""manageable problem."" An apparent contradiction, leading critics to ask what exactly is the president's plan here? This, as he gets ready to arrive at an incredibly significant NATO summit.
Also, panic as a man suspected of contracting Ebola escapes a clinic in West Africa. This video here is just now surfacing as the CDC is issuing a dire warning. Those details are next.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BALDWIN: You're watching CNN. I'm Brooke Baldwin.
Moments ago, President Obama arrived in Wales for this NATO summit, where NATO nation leaders are drawing up plans to confront Russia and Ukraine. President Obama vowing NATO will come to the defense of its allies, and by that, he means every ally.
Let's go to the White House correspondent, Michelle Kosinski, live in Wales for us.
So, Michelle, we know Ukraine, not a NATO nation, but the alliance has indicated that it will support the capital, will support Kiev in the wake of this very bold move from Putin. What should we, the world, expect out of this NATO meeting?
MICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, President Obama made that very clear. And it's something we have been hearing about for months now. But what we have been hearing about again in the last two weeks or so is the possibility that Ukraine will apply, will try to get approval, for NATO membership itself. Now, that is a process that starts within its own country, of course. But they were talking about this back in April, as well, as this Russian activity was really getting under way and the world was watching, thinking what is this?
And what are he we going to do about it? Back then, Russia saw that talk of new NATO membership as a provocation. And we heard Russia used some of that similar language in the last two days, as this has all come up again. So all of this sort of getting together collectively and talking about what to do within NATO has been going on since Russia started this campaign. But now it's here. So the president in this speech he just gave in Estonia before leaving laid it out in these sorts of five points or five goals for all the NATO nations.
And they included things like more boots on the ground, more NATO troops, patrolling over the skies. That's -- some of that has already started in the last few months, but he wants to see more of that. He wants to see NATO collectively build up the militaries as some of these more vulnerable NATO members. And by vulnerable, we mean closer to Russia or sort of within Russia's path. And also things like more money contributed by European countries to NATO defense. Now that this has gotten critical, it's kind of become glaringly obvious that the U.S. contributes most to that pool -- Brooke?
BALDWIN: And we know Jim Sciutto will be sitting down with the defense secretary, will be asking Chuck Hagel about these moves from Russia in eastern Ukraine and this cease-fire/no cease-fire talk here between Poroshenko and Putin.
Michelle Kosinski, thank you so much, in Wales ahead of that NATO meeting.
And now to Ebola. A third American conducting missionary work in West Africa has been infected with the Ebola virus. He has been identified as Dr. Rick Sakra, working for SIM USA, the same group linked to American Nancy Writebol. She, along with Dr. Kent Brantly, they, amazingly, recovered at Emory University
 

in Atlanta after being treated and since released. But complicating matters here for Dr. Sakra, CNN has learned he was actually not treating Ebola patients, unlike those others who were maybe more in close contact. He was actually working in an obstetrics unit with pregnant women. Totally separate.
This today, from the president of SIM USA, about his dream. Take a listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BRUCE JOHNSON, PRESIDENT, SIM USA: As we learned yesterday, our -- one of our SIM missionary doctors in Liberia tested positive for Ebola. We're exploring all opportunities, and options, but right now our focus is the care of Rick right there in Liberia.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BALDWIN: And now here we have this video, a patient suspected of having Ebola escaping from a Liberia clinic Monday before he could be examined. And this set off panic in a nearby public market when he began running through the streets. That happened in the same city where Dr. Sakra was working.
So let's talk about this with our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who covered this really from the get-go.
You were in Africa this year. DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah.
BALDWIN: First, what do we know? If Dr. Sakra was working with pregnant women, and babies, and wasn't working directly with these Ebola patients, how did he get it?
GUPTA: It's obviously unclear, a little mystery. Could one of these women who he was caring for, a pregnant woman, even, also have been caring the Ebola virus? We don't know. And some of those details may come out. It's sometimes hard to figure out, even with Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol, not entirely clear, if these are doctors who know how to protect themselves. As you point out, you've got to know if you're coming in contact with the virus ahead of time. So that would become more clear. He's 51 years old. He and his wife have been volunteering with this organization since the 1980s.
BALDWIN: Oh, wow.
GUPTA: I thought it was interesting. He decided to go to Liberia after Dr. Brantly and Ms. Writebol got sick with Ebola. So he was well aware of these risks, again, not working in the Ebola isolation center but still aware of these risks. He got a fever Friday evening and decided to isolate himself at that point. Fever stayed up Saturday and Sunday. And by Monday, he was diagnosed officially with Ebola. So he stays in isolation. But it sounds like he's doing OK right now. But that's sort of the sequence of events for him. A few questions still, but sounds like things OK for the time being.
BALDWIN: What about this drug that we know the other two had taken, ZMapp, right? Isn't there a new contract? Won't they now be, what, making new additional vaccines or --
GUPTA: They could be making more of the ZMapp, a medication for people affected with the Ebola virus. The vaccine trial started yesterday, as well.
BALDWIN: Yes.
GUPTA: That's to prevent people from getting infected in the first place. There's not the ZMapp right now, though. Dr. Brantly, the first person in the world to receive it.
BALDWIN: The first human being.
GUPTA: They didn't plan on making this more widely available. That process is happening now. But that particular medication is not likely to be available to him. There may be other medications. There were a few different manufacturers, as we found out, that have been working on these medications. So it's possible he may still get something. But again, sounds like he's doing well. And just another stat. Out of that same Ebola isolation area, 12 patients released yesterday who had been treated successfully for Ebola. They got the fluids back, sort of maintained, supported. Didn't get medication, but recovered. So recovery is happening among these patients. It's important to point that out.
BALDWIN: Dr. Gupta, thank you very much.
GUPTA: You got it. Thank you.
BALDWIN: And don't forget, make an appointment with ""Sanjay Gupta, M.D."", every Saturday, 4:30 p.m. eastern, right here on CNN.
 

Just ahead, Ukraine has said it has reached a cease-fire with Russia. Russia says, hang on a second, our troops aren't even in Ukraine, how could there be a cease-fire? We will try to make sense of all of this for you, this back and forth.
And President Obama has been called indecisive with a weak strategy when it comes to dealing with is. And now the pressure is coming on from members of his own party.
Stay with me, you're watching CNN.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BALDWIN: And you're watching CNN. I'm Brooke Baldwin.
200 American troops will be on the ground in Ukraine in two weeks for this military exercise. All of this comes as Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, issues a fresh denial. A Putin spokesperson says Russia does not have any troops in Ukraine, so Putin cannot confirm any possible reports of a cease-fire there. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's office says he and Russian president Vladimir Putin had agreed to the cease-fire following a phone call.
One more significant development here just a short time ago. France did decide to hold off on delivering those military warships to Russia because of what's been happening in Ukraine.
So Phil Black, let me bring you in, please, in Moscow. All this talk over what Putin did or didn't say. What kind of conversation he had with, you know, Poroshenko over this notion of a cease-fire. Can you clear it up for us?
PHIL BLACK, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's pretty complex, Brooke. But after this phone call, the Ukrainian president said we've agreed to a cease-fire. The Russian government, the Russian president, his office, said, no, no, we didn't, because Russia can't have anything to do with a cease-fire chat or process or negotiation, because we're not actually fighting, we're not party to this conflict. Russia maintaining that denial that it even has soldiers on the ground there in eastern Ukraine. Russia says it's up to the Ukrainian government and the pro-Russian separatists on the ground to agree to a cease- fire. What president Putin says they did talk about was a possible terms for a cease-fire. He's drawing distinctions here. And he's also outlining what he thinks these terms should be. Pretty obvious stuff like pulling back forces, exchanging prisoners, ensuring that refugees and aid gets in, that sort of thing. He believes that this can be agreed to when representatives from Russia, Ukraine and those pro-Russian separatists get together for a talk this Friday. He seems to think that an agreement can come together. But his belief is that Russia must support this process, it can't actually make it happen, Brooke.
BALDWIN: OK. I'm with you, but I'm not. If Putin is saying that there are no Russians in Ukraine, and that they did not discuss cease- fire but he would consider discussing terms of a cease-fire, wouldn't that infer there would be -- I'll move on. This is Vladimir Putin. Let's talk about the news of these American troops on the ground shortly for this NATO military exercise. How is Russia going to react to that, Phil?
BLACK: Well, Russia won't like it. And I think Russia's response will be unpredictable. We already know that Russia is pretty unhappy with NATO's talk of ramping up its it activity in this region, talk of more exercises, rotating more soldiers through, replacing equipment here and so forth. Russia says it's provocative and it's going to readjust its own military planning as a result.
BALDWIN: OK. Phil Black, thank you so much from Moscow.
From ISIS to what's happening there as we have been discussing in Ukraine and Russia, President Barack Obama taking a lot of criticism for his action, or perhaps inactions, on major international standoffs, foreign policy here. Now taking some heat from members of his own party. We will air some of those complaints for you, some of the requests.
Plus, mere minutes from now, do not miss this, a 20-minute live question-and-answer session here from that stage. See those empty chairs? Jim Sciutto will be sitting in one and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in the other. Time to get some answers. Don't move.
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)
BALDWIN: Let me remind you, we are moments away from our interview here on CNN with defense secretary, Chuck Hagel. CNN's chief national security correspondent, Jim Sciutto, questioning the secretary of defense about plans or lack thereof for confronting the terrorist Army that is ravaging parts of Iraq, parts of Syria, and how ISIS beheaded a second American. That will take place on that stage live from Newport, Rhode Island, at the top of the hour. Do not miss that.
 

As you know, President Barack Obama has been really getting an earful about his ongoing search for a strategy, and as if to prod him, two members of Congress say they will seek legislation soon to take the fight to ISIS.
CNN's chief Congressional correspondent, Dana Bash, joins me live from Washignton. And also in Washington, Gloria Borger, our chief political analyst.
Ladies, welcome.
Dana, to you first.
Congress isn't even in session. They'll be back next week. But, you know, not for long. I mean, what can, what will members of Congress do in the short amount of time they have before that midterm election? DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It is an open question. And even the House speaker is very much putting onus on the president. There are, as you said, more and more calls for Congress to do something, to act to give the president new authorization. That's coming from Senate Democrats, it's coming from some House Republicans, and various forms. But the reality that the House speaker talked about just this week, while, again, on recess, there is only so much Congress can do when it is the president who has to make the decision on what the strategy is. It's very difficult for Congress to authorize something that doesn't really exist. So that's really where they are now.
I can tell you, the House Republicans are actually going to have a conference call in about five minutes, 3:00 eastern, to kind of touch base with one another as they have been away for five weeks. They're going to talk mostly budget. But this issue, this question is certainly going to come up, because you can bet they are hearing about it from their constituents back home.
BALDWIN: OK. So that is Congress. We have to talk about Vice President Joe Biden.
(LAUGHTER)
Gloria, this is coming to you.
But first, for our viewers, got to play sound. He talked a little while ago this afternoon, absolutely went off talking about ISIS, the beheading of a second American, Steven Sotloff.
Gloria, I'm coming for you on the other side.
Take a listen.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And when people harm Americans, we don't retreat. We don't forget. We take care of those who are grieving. And when that's finished, they should know we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice --
(APPLAUSE)
BIDEN: -- because hell is where they will reside.
(APPLAUSE)
BIDEN: Hell is where they will reside.
(APPLAUSE)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
BALDWIN: That, Gloria Borger, is in stark contrast from some of the words we have heard from the president. Is there a disconnect? GLORIA BORGER, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, you know, Joe Biden and Barack Obama are like the into each other's yang, right? They're just such different kinds of politicians. And believe it or not, Joe Biden was probably saying the same thing that Barack Obama was saying today. But in it, you know, in a very different way. I mean, the president --
BALDWIN: Do you think that the vice president's role?
BORGER: Yeah, I do. I think he's got the passion that people believe the president ought to have more of, OK, and doesn't. What the president did today in a speech was kind of lay out a checklist for what he's going to do. He says he doesn't want this to be what he called the one-off. He said, you know, we've got to have our objective. We've got to have our targets. We've got to make the case to Congress. We've got to make the
 

case to the American people. We've got to get our allies on board. So he goes down his checklist, and Joe Biden says, you know, starts talking about the gates of hell. And I think when the president said we have to destroy them, he meant the same thing. But, of course, said in a very different way. So I think they're coming from the same place. But they're two different guys. BALDWIN: OK. Gloria Borger with the perspective, Dana Bash, thank you so much, on what's going on or maybe not with Congress and hearing from those constituents. Coming up next, you know, we're staying on this issue, CNN special event, one-on-one interview, live, with U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. He will speak out on ISIS, Russia, Ukraine, and the beheading of those two Americans. What will the U.S. do? That interview right after the break.

1 September 2014,Liberia_1.pdf,"1 September 2014 The Wall Street Journal Asia AWSJ 1 English Copyright  2014 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. DNIPROPETROVSK, Ukraine -- With its forces falling back before onslaughts in eastern Ukraine, Kiev agreed to the release of Russian paratroopers captured within its borders last week in return for 63 Ukrainians who had crossed into Russian territory to flee fighting.
The exchanges appeared to be a modest sign of a willingness to talk on the eve of cease-fire negotiations in Minsk, Belarus, on Monday, which Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said could be decisive.
Kiev has taken a hard line in previous talks as it sought to regain territory taken by Moscow-backed rebels. But after Russian troops openly intervened, reversing Kiev's gains and leaving hundreds of its soldiers surrounded, Mr. Poroshenko may be preparing to make concessions.
Moscow appeared to be hardening its demands and to be ready to press Kiev to accept outright secession of its two eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.
In remarks broadcast on Russia's state television, President Vladimir Putin called for ""substantive, meaningful negotiations, and not on technical issues but on the political organization of society and statehood in the southeast of Ukraine.""
Mr. Putin's use of the word ""statehood"" could indicate he will press for independence for the provinces, rather than just increased autonomy for them within Ukraine.
Later on Sunday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would be wrong to interpret Mr. Putin's comments as an endorsement of statehood for the eastern regions, the Interfax news agency reported. He said any such issues would have to be decided in talks between ""Ukraine and Novorossiya,"" using the Tsarist-era term for a region that includes much of present-day southern and eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's setbacks have prompted alarm among Western officials, but little signs of outright military aid.
Mr. Poroshenko returned Sunday from a European Union summit in Brussels after the EU agreed to draw up options within a week for possible new sanctions against Russia. He left, though, without any promise of military support from the bloc's 28 governments.
While European leaders said there was a clear determination to press ahead with sanctions if Russia didn't scale back its intervention, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said leaders hadn't defined clear criteria for triggering fresh measures at Saturday's meeting. However, governments were ready to quickly move ahead given the deterioration of the situation in eastern Ukraine, he said at a postsummit news conference.
On Saturday, after a meeting with Mr. Poroshenko, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso warned that the situation in Ukraine was approaching ""a point of no return."" He said the bloc hoped for a cease-fire but made clear any agreement would require a withdrawal of Russian troops and quick measures to stem the flow of weapons and fighters over the border.
A senior EU aide who participated in Saturday's summit said meeting those demands would likely be the prerequisite for any decision to delay sanctions.
Still, some member states remain wary about pursuing tougher measures, partly because of concerns about economic retaliation. Some governments also believe that economic tensions will make a political solution less likely.
Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann was blunt about those concerns, although he didn't rule out increasing economic pressure if Moscow continued to block a political solution.
 

""The effect of sanctions as they have been applied so far hasn't always produced what some expected,"" he said. ""We should be speaking less about sanctions,"" he said. Others leaders, meanwhile, were pressing for the bloc to do more. EU sanctions haven't been effective because they were ""too general, not targeted enough and mostly for future contracts,"" Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said. ""It was not applied for existing contracts, and this is a huge mistake."" Under the July EU sanctions, already signed defense contracts such as France's sale of the Mistral war ship to Russia were allowed to proceed. The Lithuanian leader also called for the bloc to meet Mr. Poroshenko's request for military aid. Ukraine ""is fighting a war on behalf of the whole of Europe"" with Russia, she said. ""And that means that we need to help Ukraine to defend itself, its territory and its people and to help militarily, especially with military materials."" The White House, meanwhile, expressed support for EU leaders' pursuit of possible new sanctions and said the U.S. continues to look for ways ""to hold Russia accountable for its illegal actions in Ukraine."" --Deborah Solomon contributed to this article License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service","Russia, Ukraine Swap Soldiers Ahead of Talks

Hanoi, August 28 (VNA)? Spokesman for the Foreign Ministry Le Hai Binh gave an overview of Vietnam?s foreign affairs and other issues of public concern during the monthly press briefing in Hanoi on August 28.
Regarding the recent China visit of Politburo member and permanent member of the Party Central Committee?s Secretariat Le Hong Anh as Special Envoy of Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Binh said leaders of the two Parties and countries agreed to continue directing their efforts towards creating a healthy and stable relationship.
Furthermore, both sides will foster exchanges between the two Parties and countries, and will restore and enhance cooperation on politics, diplomacy, national defence and security, economics, trade, investment, and law.
In addition, they pledged to abide by the key common views of the leaders of the Parties and countries; to comply in sincerity with the basic principles guiding the settlement of maritime disputes; to make good use of mechanisms at the government-level for conducting negotiations on Vietnamese-Chinese territorial borders; and to seek fundamental and long-term approaches that are acceptable to both sides.
Vietnam and China will work in ways that will not impact their respective positions, including on cooperation and development issues; will manage maritime disputes effectively; and will avoid actions that have the potential to complicate and enlarge disputes, in order to safeguard a peaceful relationship and stability in the East Sea.
In response to the Vietnam News Agency?s questions on Vietnam?s position on the Palestine? Israel ceasefire agreement on August 26, Binh said that Vietnam welcomes the move and calls on all concerned parties to respect the truce, increase negotiations on a comprehensive and sustainable peace deal, and ensure peace and stability in the region.
Regarding Vietnam?s stance on the escalating violence triggered by the Islamic state group in Iraq, Binh said Vietnam is deeply concerned by the situation and condemns inhuman actions and atrocities committed against innocent civilians.
?We back efforts by the international community and Iraqi administration to restore stability soon, ensuring Iraqi sovereignty and territorial integrity for peace and stability in the region,? he added.
Turning to Vietnam?s initiative at the ASEANNavy Chiefs? meeting in Bangkok on August 27 to increase the role of the ASEAN navies in addressing challenges beyond 2015, the spokesman said contributions should be made to the establishment of a fully-fledged ASEAN community by the end of 2015.
When asked about the ongoing census of Vietnamese nationals in Cambodia, Binh said a working mission of the Cambodian government has checked registration and citizenship papers to safeguard the interests of the Vietnamese community in Cambodia.
On the situation of the Vietnamese community in Ebola-infected countries, he said that Vietnamese citizens living in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Liberia remain safe. They have been warned to stay away from affected areas and have been advised to seek assistance from agencies representing Vietnam in emergency cases.
Regarding the appeal made to Vietnamese Ukrainians to join the army, Binh made it clear that almost all Ukrainians of Vietnamese descent are exempted from military service since they are currently pursuing their education, both inside and outside of the country. Individuals who are registered as students or have health problems are exempt from military duty, he assured.
During the press briefing, he also informed the media that 12 Vietnamese fishermen will be returning from the Philippines on August 30.
The Vietnamese embassy in the Netherlands and agencies representing Vietnam abroad will verify the identities of the three Vietnamese victims in the MH17 plane accident and will arrange for their remains to be returned to Vietnam./.",Spokesman clarifies Vietnam?s international position,Vietnam News Agency Bulletin VIETNA English
