This will be the new project structure for orlog
Right now, there is probably a lot of path wierdness going on.

This directory will eventually form the "base" of the entire project.
This means that all submodules created for this project will be maintained
from here.

The project structure will be like this:
Tidy, nice and maintainable...

-| Root
-| control script(s)?
   perhaps just one, that accepts arguments...
-| readme

----|-logs

----|resources # *
----|----|data # data needed
----|----|models # models used

----|modules # codebase
----|----| * modules

----|venv # venv for project (packrat?)

"control.py" examples:

control.py classify $ID / $URL-LIST/$QUERY-LIST (csv) -r #retrain (data will be full-bodied)

control.py s2v -output $MODEL_NAME # automatic? -f #full (all data will be used)
