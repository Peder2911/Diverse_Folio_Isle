Diverse Folio Isle is a framework for doing text-mining using the Montanus scraper,
or other data sources (currently supports csv-files and sqlite .db-files).

The program has a simple CLI that is accessed through the deScry.py script.
Documentation will be a priority once the project is in alpha.

Note:
Batteries are not included.
You need two things for the system to work:

1 ) - A keys.json file must be added to the Montanus-module, containing your API
keys for the different APIs. The path for this file is:
./modules/Montanus/configFiles/keys.json

2 ) - Vectorization (.bin) and classification (.rds) models are currently not included.
You could either train your own models using sent2vec and R, or send me an email @
pglandsverk@gmail.com.
The paths in which to put your models are:
./resources/models/classifiers (for .rds classifiers)
./resources/models/embedders (for sent2vec .bin-files)

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about the project.
